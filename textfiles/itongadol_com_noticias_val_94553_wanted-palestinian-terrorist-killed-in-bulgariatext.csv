He was sentenced to life in prison, but was able to escape jail while being transferred to hospital during a hunger strike, and has been living in Bulgaria for the past 22 years. Israel demanded Bulgarian authorities extradite him in December. Zaid is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) Marxist terrorist organization. On Friday morning the PFLP claimed that the Mossad had assassinated Zaid. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas published an official statement of condemnation, calling to establish an international investigative committee to clarify the circumstances of Zaid\’s death.
