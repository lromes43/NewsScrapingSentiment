Feb 26, 2016 — The road to justice for Garrett Phillips and his family has taken another unexpected turn. Phillips was the 12-year-old boy who was strangled to death in his mother's apartment in Potsdam almost four and a half years ago. Attorneys for the man charged with the murder, Nick Hillary, have said the prosecution lied to the court about DNA evidence. The accusations were included in a letter to St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain and the judge in the case, Jerome Richards. The prosecutor in question, Onondaga County DA William Fitzpatrick, strongly denies the allegations. The letter was first acquired and reported on by the Watertown Daily Times Wednesday evening. Allegations of ""untruthfulness"" in a court chambers conference Nick Hillary's murder trial was delayed for a second time recently, and there’s still no court date. The case is in a holding pattern in public, but the letter gives us a glimpse of the discussions and, at times, acrimony, that are proceeding behind closed doors. Collins' letter accuses DA Mary Rain’s special assistant in the case, William Fitzpatrick of “untruthfulness” during a closed chambers conference with the judge on January 25. According to a part of the transcript from that conference that’s quoted in the letter, Judge Richards asked Fotzpatrick about DNA tests done using a new high-tech method called TrueAllele. According to the letter, Fitzpatrick said, “I have not seen any report from TrueAllele.” Upon further questioning from the judge, he said again, “I don’t know if they (Mary Rain’s office) went to TrueAllele.” Those answers appear to contradict, Collins argued, emailed correspondence between Fitzpatrick and the company that runs the TrueAllele tests dated last November, about three months before the closed chambers meeting. In those emails, Fitzpatrick asked specifically about “the case from St. Lawrence County that TrueAllele analyzed months ago.” Collins called that apparent discrepancy “shocking and disappointing and frankly outrageous.” Related stories:Why is justice for Garrett Phillips so complicated?In an interview with NCPR Thursday, Fitzpatrick confirmed those emails are his, adding he had already shared them with the defense as a part of court-ordered discovery in the case. But he said the TrueAllele data he was referring to was not actual reports. ""I mean, it was very distressing to see yourself called a liar, so I actually checked with the state police just to be 100% certain, and I was told, again, there is no report from TrueAllele, and the information contained in the emails was already provided,"" Fitzpatrick said. District Attorney Mary Rain wouldn’t comment further because there’s a gag order on the case, except to accuse the defense of leaking Collins' letter to the Times. The Times, however, says it got the letter from ""someone not involved in the case."" ""The defense has violated the gag order by providing the media with a letter full of rhetoric, and the People are always going to take the high road. We’re not going to do the mudslinging the defense has done,"" Rain said. Nick Hillary’s lawyer who wrote the letter, John Collins, said he wouldn’t comment further because of the gag order. But the defense has reiterated it didn’t leak the letter. ""No statistical support"" for a DNA match The letter reveals new details about the prosecution's use of DNA evidence in the effort to convict Hillary. Mark Perlin, president of Cybergenetics, the company that conducts TrueAllele tests, refers to a report from September 2014, in which Nick Hillary’s DNA was tested against DNA found under the fingernails of Garrett Phillips. He writes the TrueAllele tests found “no statistical support” for a match between Hillary and the fingernail DNA. If that were the only DNA tests done, that could be considered a significant blow to the prosecution's case, given that Potsdam police have testified in a deposition that they had no evidence that ""physically placed Oral Nicholas Hillary at the crime scene.” But the letter also makes clear the prosecution has used another cutting-edge DNA analysis – one invented in New Zealand, called STRMix. But the emails don't reveal the results of those tests. A debate over DNA analysis The evidence is being weighed amidst an ongoing national debate over the use of DNA tests in criminal trials. Traditional DNA testing has come under scrutiny, particularly tests of samples containing the DNA of multiple people. In the past, lab pathologists have had to analyze those samples and then make judgement calls, explains Seth Augenstein, a staff writer for Forensic Magazine. What new, cutting-edge technologies, like TrueAllele and STRMix, do is use huge computing power and complex logarithms to take the decision out of human hands. ""Instead of involving that subjective ballpark by the analyst,"" Augenstein said, the computer tests ""put it all together. It’s so much more accurate that you get to the truth."" Augenstein said TruAllele has been used in hundreds of cases, including in New York courts, and including cases prosecuted by William Fitzpatrick. STRMix is newer, and was only admitted for use in a U.S. court for the first time last December in Michigan. The Albany Times-Union editorial board this week called for the state legislature to investigate the issue. Sorting through mountains of evidence It’s been four and a half years since Garrett Phillips' murder rocked Potsdam, St. Lawrence County, and the North Country. There are boxes and boxes containing thousands of pages of evidence, and hard drives full of more evidence. Meanwhile, both sides have had a reshuffling of the attorneys in charge of the case. Hillary is on his third legal team. The prosecution is on its second DA, and Fitzpatrick was originally brought on as a special prosecutor in 2014. Those changes, combined with the huge body of evidence, is making it difficult for both sides to sort through the evidence that's going to be presented to a jury and be sure they’re prepared and ready to go to trial."
