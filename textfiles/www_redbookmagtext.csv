Brace yourselves: Everything you've ever known or heard about G-spots and clitoral stimulation is about to change forever. As it turns out, it's possible to get an orgasm without direct clitoral stimulation through a few sensitive spots in other areas of your body, says Claire Cavanah, co-founder of Babeland and co-author of Moregasm: Babeland's Guide To Mind-Blowing Sex. Specifically, if you find what we like to call the orgasm button. Yes, skeptics, this is really a thing. In the world of Acupressure and Chinese Medicine, it's called the Sea Of Energy (Conception Vessel 6), a spot located three finger widths below your belly button. Here, to be exact: According to acupressure experts, firmly pressing this spot with your fingers for two to three minutes and focusing on breathing can, over time, deplete energy blockages that have stored up from things like stress and emotional trauma. And when those energy blockages are released, blood can properly flow into your genitals and sometimes be intense enough to get you there. With practice, it is possible to release that blocked energy, improve blood flow, and ultimately have an incredible orgasm, says Michael Reed Gach, Ph.D., director of Acupressure.com and author of Acupressure for Lovers. To really heat things up, Daniel Reid, Chinese medicine expert and best-selling author of The Tao of Health, Sex, And Longevity, recommends doing it with your husband as opposed to alone. According to Taoist health philosophies, this allows you both to absorb each other's sexual energy, making everything much more intense. Now, we're not saying this is your typical Saturday night rendezvous and it's going to work every single time—if that were the case, we'd all quickly become recluses, like when Charlotte discovered the mystical powers of The Rabbit in SATC. But if you're feeling particularly frisky with the Mister, it's definitely something to try. A word of caution before signing off: While the orgasm button is obviously great for, well, orgasming, the Sea of Energy point is also known to help to relieve bloat and constipation (hence, why it also doubles as ""the poop button""). So, in short, you might wanna take a trip to the ladies room before foreplay begins, or you could be in for a different kind of adventure that probably isn't very sexy, if you know what I mean...
