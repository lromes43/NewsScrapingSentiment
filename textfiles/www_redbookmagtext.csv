2016-02-26,"She's appealing a ban on using the frozen eggs. A woman is fighting the British courts for the chance to carry her daughter's frozen eggs so she can give birth to her own grandchild, according to The Guardian. The unidentified 60-year-old woman's only daughter died in 2011 at age 28. The daughter had her eggs frozen in 2008 after being diagnosed with cancer, according to the outlet, and had discussed surrogacy with her mother. According to the BBC, the mother lost a court case last year but the court of appeals has now granted her permission to challenge the decision on the grounds that there was ""an arguable case"" as to what the daughter, who did not have a partner, wanted done with her eggs in the case of her death. The mother is hoping to bring the eggs to a U.S. clinic to be used with donor sperm, according to the report. ""It seems to me that it is arguable that the HFEA [Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority] and the [high court] judge took too stringent an approach to the question of special directions,"" the judge said in the ruling obtained by The Guardian. ""There had been a failure to approach the available evidence correctly in relation to … a conversation between the [daughter] and the mother."" According to The Guardian, the daughter filled out paperwork for her eggs to be stored for 10 years in the case of her death, but she didn't fill out the forms with instructions on what should be done with the eggs. If the mother wins the case, she could become the first person in the world to become pregnant with the eggs of a dead daughter, according to the BBC.
