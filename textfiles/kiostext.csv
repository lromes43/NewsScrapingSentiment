2016-02-26,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Supporters of renewable energy are launching a petition campaign to demonstrate public backing for local wind projects in Lancaster County. The campaign unveiled Friday will collect signatures on a new website, www.lancasterwind.org. The petition drive comes in response to the Lancaster County Board's Nov. 10 vote to impose noise restrictions on wind turbines. Wind energy supporters say the regulations make it impossible to build a commercial wind energy project in Nebraska's second most populous county. Organizers say the petition is intended to show that county residents disagree with board members. The petition sponsors include state Sen. Ken Haar of Malcom, farm groups, unions, renewable energy companies and civic and environmental groups.    Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
