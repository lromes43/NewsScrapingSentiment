Profits, meanwhile amounted to €172m up from €140m in 2014. The group’s CEO, Yannick Bolloré, said that every division within the group is growing. He also noted that its home market of France led the way but pointed out that the UK chalked up organic growth of 4.4% while Spain, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Hungary and Ireland all posted double-digit growth. In North America, which now accounts for around 36% of group revenues, organic growth of 6.4% was achieved. “These results are the outcome of a highly effective strategy centred on collaboration and integration among all the group’s areas of expertise, to provide our clients with an efficient and innovative service that seamlessly combines creative, media and digital. These excellent figures give us every reason to start the year with confidence; they must also motivate us to redouble our efforts to ensure the quality and innovation of our offerings,” said Bolloré."
