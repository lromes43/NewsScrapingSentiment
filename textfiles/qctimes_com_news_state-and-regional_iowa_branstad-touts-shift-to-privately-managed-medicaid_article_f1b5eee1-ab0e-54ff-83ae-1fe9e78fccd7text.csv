2016-02-26,"JOHNSTON, Iowa — Gov. Terry Branstad expressed confidence Friday that Iowa is moving ahead April 1 with a federally approved plan to deliver privately managed care to Medicaid recipients.   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. Here are other topics from Friday’s taping of IPTV’s “Iowa Press” show with Gov. Terry Branstad: MINIMUM WAGE: The governor reiterated that he would be open to considering an increase in the state’s $7.25 hourly minimum wage but doubted the split-control Legislature would pass one this session. SEEKING A SEVENTH TERM: The longest-serving governor in U.S. history said he would decide later whether to run for re-election again. “I'm going to wait until 2018 like Bob Ray did when I was lieutenant governor. I love this job, and I'm going to keep working hard every day to serve the people of Iowa and do as well as I can.” STATE AID TO SCHOOLS: The governor said he has recommended a 2.45 percent increase for fiscal 2017 and thinks that is an achievable level given the economy and the possibility that state revenue growth will get scaled back again next month. “I don't think we can afford to go more than 2.45 percent,” he said. “We have a very prudent conservative budget approach that we have taken and that is why I've cautioned Senate Democrats, you can't increase the level of spending at 4 percent. That's not realistic. The 2.45 percent was a real stretch to get to there, and I believe we can do that.” TAX COUPLING: The governor said he would be willing to go along with House Republicans’ income tax coupling plan to extend $95 million in state tax breaks to Iowa small business owners and farmers who purchased assets in 2015 by aligning with federal tax changes. The action would reduce the state’s ending surplus balance, he said. “It will be tight, and it will use up a lot of the surplus over and above what we have in the economic and cash emergency account, but we could accept for one year,” the governor said, adding, however, that he would not agree to halt a plan to do away with a manufacturing sales tax as part of a compromise deal with Senate Democrats. MEDICAL MARIJUANA: The governor said he would be willing to look at legislation to allow more limited uses of marijuana-derived oil to help more victims of debilitating health problems but made no promise of support. “As I did last time when we dealt with this issue for epilepsy, I'm going to reserve judgment to see what it might look like in its final form. I have empathy for the families that are dealing with these health-related issues. But I also want to make sure we don't have drugs getting into the wrong hands. So we need to handle this in a very careful way. But I'm going to monitor it and reserve judgment until I see it in its final form.”  Get local news delivered to your inbox!
