Facebook photo ""This particular person was served with a PFA -- a protection from abuse order -- at 3:30 yesterday afternoon, and the first shooting happens at 5 o'clock,"" Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. ""So with that I'm kind of thinking something triggered it, and maybe it was that PFA that was served."" Walton said the protection order, which was filed by Ford's girlfriend, was served to Ford at work. He then left the plant. The sheriff added that he was familiar with Ford. 'He's spent some time in my jail,"" Walton said. Ford was fatally shot by an officer during an exchange of gunfire. Walton called the officer a hero. ""He is an absolute hero. You've got to realize there were 200 to 300 more people in there. Two hundred to 300 more people left there, and if it wasn't for that officer, they may not have left there,"" Walton said. ""The shooter wasn't done shooting. He was going to keep shooting."" Authorities identified the three people killed as Brian Sadowsky, 44, Joshua Higbee, 31, and Renee Benjamin, 30. Several victims remain hospitalized at three hospitals. At a media briefing Thursday morning, Walton laid out the timeline of events. At about 5 p.m., 911 in Newton receives a report of a shooting near 12th Street and Meridian Road. “A man driving with his two children was shot. He got shot in the shoulder. A second car coming this way was also shot at. She did not get hit – a miracle. It just went through the windshield,"" Walton said. KMBC The second shooting was reported near Old 81 Highway and 36th Street, close to Meridian Road. ""What happened at this location is the shooter went head on into oncoming traffic. Both vehicles went off into the ditch. The shooter was getting out his car, the driver getting out his car. The shooter then shoots that driver and takes that victim's car,"" Walton said. The shooter drove up to Hesston and the Excel plant. ""Once he gets to Excel, he goes to the northeast section of the building, exits and shoots an individual who is in the parking lot. He then enters the doors at the northeast corner of the building and goes inside. A sheriff’s deputy pulls up in the parking lot and reports that he's being fired upon. The deputy was not hurt. The shooter then goes into the building and at that point shoots 14 more people. Three of those were fatalities,"" Walton said. A Hesston police officer who responded to the plant, meets the shooter toward the front office area of Excel about 5:24 p.m. ""They exchange fire. The Hesston police officer shoots and kills Cedric Larry Keith Ford, a 38-year-old man,"" Walton said. Investigators said Ford was armed with an assault rifle and automatic pistol. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback said preliminary information indicated Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder was the one who shot and killed the gunman suspected of killing three people at a factory. Agents with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation were investigating the crime scene at the plant. The FBI has been interviewing witnesses. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was looking into how Ford obtained the weapons. Walton said there will be a separate investigation for the officer-involved shooting.
