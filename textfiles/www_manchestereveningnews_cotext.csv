2016-02-26,"OBI  Property founders Dominic Horridge and Will Lewis. With three consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, launching a business in the middle of the recession may have seemed a risky move, but it was one a trio of former colleagues decided to take anyway. Now with views over St Peter’s Square, Manchester, OBI Property’s newly fitted-out office at 80 Mosley Street, reflects this firm’s ambition and success. Having grown steadily over the last six years, and now with a team of 18, OBI has established itself as a real contender in the property market, even topping the list as the most prolific leasing advisor in central Manchester. With big name clients including AO.com, NCC Group, Rentalcars.com, Allied London, LJ Partnership, and British Airways, OBI Property has certainly made its mark. Founded by Will Lewis, Dominic Horridge and former director Gary Scorah in 2010, OBI Property offers services in business relocation, real estate solutions, tenant advisory service and workplace consultancy. The trio, who met while working at WHR, made the brave decision to launch in February 2010. OBI Property Lewis said: “We thought the recession would last a year, but it wasn’t just a recession as people had known previously, it was a global meltdown and no one in the market really had the experience or the know how to get through it. “I guess we were pretty naive and young, but we wanted to start something of our own. “There’s a lot of surveying firms run by surveyors, but not necessarily business people, and this is what we wanted to do. “We all had young children and responsibilities and everyone thought we were bonkers. But the lowest part of launching a business was people questioning us, as they obviously didn’t believe in us. “However, those that did support us, have backed us ever since.” OBI Property was launched in a small back office at 80 Mosley Street, with no windows, no wall dressings and just enough space for the trio and their PA. But that didn’t stop clients appointing OBI property immediately.  OBI  property  Mosley Street Manchester.

. Within the first six months, the real estate firm was appointed by its first major client, the owners of the building they were occupying, Bilsdale Properties, which is controlled by the family trusts of the late steel tycoon and Blackburn Rovers FC owner Jack Walker. Lewis said: “We were working with them for six months when I asked them why their business came with us? They said it was a philosophy from the late Jack Walker that business is about people, and that gave us confidence.” Starting a business is always a challenge, but OBI faced one of its toughest when they were taken to court by their former employers, WHR. “We won in the high court, but no one really wins in such an occasion. It was a huge distraction while we were trying to establish ourselves, but it meant we worked even harder. “So the first year was hindered by that, but when that finished, the work we did was very steady.” As OBI Property grew, business partner and investment expert Scorah decided to leave and launch his own business. The exit was amicable says Lewis. “Gary decided to leave and start an investment firm, but we were growing and adding services all the time such as rating work and interior design work and place consultancy.  “The day Gary left, the investment world took off, so we had to make a big decision, do we replace Gary or do we do without an investment agent? We continued without one, and we now do investment consultancy but only for those clients we are close to. But what that has enabled us to do, is when a niche investment agent is looking to do a deal, they always bring us in to provide support.” For a small firm, OBI Property won other high profile clients, including commercial property giant Bruntwood and developer Allied London, who were at the start of their journey to transform Spinningfields as a business and leisure destination. Horridge said: “It was quite surprising how many new clients we got in our first year as well as clients who decided to follow us from our previous jobs. “We had a good mix of local, national and international clients in the first six months and despite some things being out of our control, we really enjoyed building the business.” The success of the business has been down to its relentlessness to pursue landlord and occupier clients which understand ‘the OBI difference’ and engage the firm in a multitude of service disciplines. OBI Property team Major developer clients, such as Allied London, Benson Elliott, LJ Partnership, and CBRE Global Investors, have engaged the business in asset management roles including interior design, project management, dilapidations, rating, leasing and investment consultancy. Since its beginnings, the business carved a niche in occupier work, applying its multi service business model to the likes of AO.com, Citation, MoneyPlus Group, Slater & Gordon, Rentalcars.com and NCC Group. OBI Property says its ability to fully understand its clients’ briefs from a design perspective ensures it provides holistic advice throughout the process and acquires the right space for that particular client. Lewis said: “The second year of the business was about expanding the team, we only had six people, but we have always trained young people and we put them though their professional exams. “In the third year, the market was still tough, but it was easy to stand out as quality advise and results, whether it be settling a dilapidation claim, leasing an empty office building or refurbishing a building 15% lower than a competitive quote, really mattered, as every penny we were able to save a client counted. The competition couldn’t do what we were doing, but as the market improved, it was actually harder to show that we do offer that extra level of value because people then appraise things thoroughly as they did in the hard times.” In 2013, OBI Property won in the young business of the year category at the MEN Business of the Year Awards, having shown impressive growth since its launch. Lewis said: “We could have been more aggressive with our growth, but it’s not our way. “For us it was about getting the right people on board, and we’ve been very selective. It was a challenge to get the good people to join a start-up, but we’ve done that. “We’ve always tried to disrupt the market in how we position our clients’ assets, how we brand and how we market. “We use animation, we use video marketing and we introduced OBI TV in year three and an OBI app two years ago. “People said that our age was a negative when we first set out. But we are open with clients, and with us they get energy, passion, and clients trust us. They know that we will go the extra mile to give the right advise and a lot of the time that means doing more work, but that’s what drives us.” The firm, has grown revenues from £500,000 in the first year and is on target to reach £3.5m for its current financial year ending in April. OBI Property has also doubled the size of its office recently taking it from 1,500 sq ft to 3,300 sq ft. The space includes more meeting rooms, a design hub, quiet booths and the new Clockwork concept. Clockwork is a touchdown space for visiting clients to work in, host meetings, utilise the bar facilities or simply relax. Presently, OBI Property is in confident mood about the future and believes Manchester is perfectly placed to continue its success story. Lewis added: “We believe we have entered into a mature part of the current property cycle, whereby rental growth will be prevalent throughout 2016. “Manchester has a really healthy development pipeline, with a variety of stock coming through – offering different locations and styles of specifications which provides occupiers with a good range of choice. “We are at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse and the local business community appears incredibly robust – we are confident the Manchester property market will continue to perform positively for the foreseeable future. “Our growth will remain opportunity-driven and we have considered expanding in other regional cities on a number of occasions. “We are, however, a professional services business and we fully appreciate that we are only as good as our team – and our team is absolutely fantastic. “Any future growth will be heavily dependent on the talent of those who want to work with us. In these times when mergers and acquisitions are becoming increasingly common, we certainly have no intentions of joining one of the big firms.” At  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.
