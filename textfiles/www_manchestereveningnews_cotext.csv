2016-02-26,"Family run business, Floorbrite, has announced a clutch of new national business contracts to the tune of £1.5m as it reveals ambitious plans to reach £20m revenues by 2020. The news comes just eight months after the Sale-based cleaning and facilities service provider, announced record turnover of £10m as well as a new board of directors. The new contracts mean the family run firm will now provide cleaning services across the whole of the UK. The cleaning and facilities management firm will now provide full daily cleaning services in 18 cities across the UK, from Portsmouth to Cardiff and Aberdeen thanks to winning a contract with Phoenix Medical, amongst others. Floorbite, which employs more than 1,000 people, acquired the additional £1.5m of new business in the last six months and marks a significant step forward for the firm achieving its ambitious 2020 growth target of £20m. Joint managing director, Nik Wyers, said: “We’ve been operating nationally for some time, but we’re thrilled to have bolstered our national portfolio even further with these new business wins. “Our heritage is firmly in the north west of England but working in different cities across the UK brings both opportunities and challenges for us and we’re looking forward to working with more customers from across the country. “Since the business was founded back in 1972 we’ve built up an impressive portfolio of work and an incredibly strong network of suppliers and staff across the country so it’s testament to them that we’ve been awarded this additional £1.5m of national business.” In recent years, Floorbrite has responded to customer demand by expanding its standalone cleaning company to offering a fully tailored facilities management solution in the retail, office, healthcare, education, manufacturing, industrial, entertainment and leisure sectors. Set up in 1972, Floorbrite is now owned and operated by chairman Linda Wyers, managing directors Alex Wyers, and Nik Wyers, marketing director Nina Wyers, HR Director Jane Anderson and Finance Director Helen Gosnay.
