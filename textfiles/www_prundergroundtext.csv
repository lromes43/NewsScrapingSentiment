					New York, NY (PRUnderground) February 26th, 2016

AIREX Markets, the award winning marketplace for financial apps, information, and reports (Financial AIR™) with over half a million individually purchasable products has added Asbury Research, Bear Traps Report and Real Estate Foresight.  Our new partners will be listed alongside products from the largest and most respected global publishers including S&P Capital IQ, Morningstar, Factset, EDI, and many more. AIREX aims to help support the investment decisions of all investors and financial service professionals, from RIAs and hedge fund/asset managers, and active traders. Access to AIREX Markets is free, keeping in line with its mission to democratize the world’s financial information.


Asbury Research is a boutique research provider, utilizing a unique blend of quantitative, technical, and behavioral metrics and proprietary models that aim to be more intuitive and forward-looking than the common Wall Street approach, which helps to keep clients one step ahead of the market. Asbury focuses on the US financial markets, including US stocks and market sectors, US interest rates, the US Dollar, and economically-influential commodities like gold, copper, and crude oil.  


Bear Traps is independent investment research from the elite team of analysts and strategists on The Bear Traps Team. Reports include specific investments alerts and market commentary, as well as actionable ideas derived from global, political market moving events, i.e Federal Reserve policy decisions. Their vast resources cover fixed income, credit, stocks, commodities, ETFs, and volatility. Bear Traps reveals the dangers of future political moves and guides investors along the pathway to safety.


Real Estate Foresight is a Hong Kong-based research provider, focusing on data and analytics from the Chinese market in order to identify turning points in the market and provide international clients with extensive analysis of the latest data, qualitative, and policy factors. 


“Listing our research reports alongside the incredible variety of financial products in the AIREX Markets is a clear value add for us,” said John Kosar, Director of Research at Asbury Research.
“We are delighted to be in AIREX Markets,” said Robert Ciemniak, Founder of Real Estate Foresight. “AIREX enables us to bring our unique Chinese market research and analysis to a deeper, broader set of investors, worldwide.”
On the new additions to the marketplace, Stephen Kuhn, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder,  said, “Airex is excited and honored to add such prestigious firms to our list of top tier research providers. We’re proud to have the only platform-as-a-service that provides customized marketplaces to any company so their customers, clients, website traffic, and employees easily and instantly find, acquire, and consume financial information.”
