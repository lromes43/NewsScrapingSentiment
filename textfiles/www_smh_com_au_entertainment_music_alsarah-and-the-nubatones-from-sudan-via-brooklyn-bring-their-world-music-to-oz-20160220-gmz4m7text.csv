Alsarah​, singer and songwriter – born in Sudan, now living in Brooklyn – is articulate, quick and forthright about the music she makes, where it comes from and how to talk about its place in the world. And she has a lot to say about that loaded term ""tradition"" that is too often equated with notions of preservation and resistance to change.  ""I think of myself as a modern musician, I don't think of myself as a traditional musician at all,"" she says. ""I make a form of retro-pop, I draw my inspiration from traditional music – but to me that's perfectly normal, everybody does.  You don't make music in a vacuum, separate from other things or other people. Music is not meant to be stagnant.""   Her band, Alsarah and The Nubatones​, are coming to Australia for WOMADelaide​, and will be playing in Melbourne as part of Brunswick Music Festival. The band draws on a range of sources and sounds – an approach that reflects, among other things, Alsarah's belief in the notion that ""everything that is traditional today was once pop"".  Alsarah was born in Sudan and lived there until the age of eight. Her parents, who are academics, moved to Yemen, then when she was 12, they went to the US.  She did her tertiary studies at Wesleyan University, which has a famous world music program, and wrote her senior thesis on an all-female Sudanese sect, the Zar, who use music to induce possession. She would never have imagined at that point, that she would form a band.  ""I knew music was going to be a part of my life, but I didn't think I would be a performer, I thought I would teach or work in a music library. But when I graduated from college, I thought I'd give it a whirl.""  Alsarah had been brought up surrounded by music, with different influences at different stages of her life.  ""My parents loved music, they loved poetry and art. We always had a lot of artists coming in and out of the house."" Her mother, like her mother before her, she recalls, ""used to have these Thursday night sessions at our house, inviting artist and musician friends over, informal salons where local musicians would come, sing a new song, read a new poem. discuss some new philosophy. I grew up with that happening every week.""  When she came to the US, she says, ""I became obsessed with the blues"", but she took in plenty of other influences as well. ""Incan and Mayan music, I was into the pan flutes, you couldn't stop me!"" She discovered the concept of roots music, and in the world music choir she joined at school, they sang everything from East European songs to Appalachian and Shaker music. It made her go back to the sounds she grew up with, and she began to ask herself, ""What does our traditional music sound like?"" The idea of tradition, however, is complex and multi-faceted. It took time to get a band together, determine a repertoire, write songs. An important factor in her development, she says, had been hearing an album called Let Me Be, by Sudanese singer Rasha, who is based in Spain. ""An album of modern music, in Arabic, performed and composed by a Sudanese woman – she inspired me, she made me realise I could be a Sudanese singer"":  At her first professional gig in New York, she met a man who would become one of the founding members of the Nubatones, oud player Haig Manoukian​, who died two years ago. ""May he rest in peace,"" she says. ""I first played with him in this giant orchestra doing Arabic classical repertoire for a Greek dance company – I've done some weird gigs – and he ended up taking me under his wing. ""Being in a band is not a business, it's not really like anything else. It's a really intimate relationship. It's family, taken with the good and the bad and the weird and the crazy, and they have your back on stage. There's a lot of trust."" She suffered at first from crippling stage-fright, she says. ""Sometimes I would freeze, it took a long time to get over it."" Her academic music training, she says, prepared her for many things, but it didn't prepare her for certain aspects of a life in music – among them ""being on stage, being in a band, communicating with musicians, learning how to say what you want"". Female musicians and bandleaders often have to deal with people's preconceptions about their place in the group, she says – most of the time, it's assumed by others that the male musicians are the ones in charge, the decision-makers. People also tend to assume that singers are not really musicians, or that they don't need to work at what they do – ""that it all comes naturally"".  But her study had value in other ways. Ethnomusicology gave her tools to think about music's history and context.""There's so much that's passed down to us that's opinions not facts, there's so much passed down to us that's government propaganda about who we are and what our art is and what it should look like. So I'm really glad that I had the techniques and tools of study,"" she says, that allowed her ""to construct the musical world I was trying to build"".  For example, growing up, she says, she remembers listening to aghani-al-banat, or ""girls' songs"" – the most popular music in Sudan, ""fusion music that comes from the centre and doesn't belong to any one tribe"" – and being told that however popular this music was, it couldn't be taken seriously. ""That it's lowbrow, something you sing around the house, that girls do, it's not real art."" On the band's debut album, Silt, there are several examples of aghani-al-banat given the Alsarah and the Nubatones treatment. For a wedding song, Habibi Taal​, that would normally be performed with voice, claps and drums, ""We added a whole lot of other instruments and did it really differently – it was my whole point, tradition and pop are hand in hand, they go really well together.""   Alongside these songs, there's plenty of original material. Her creative process varies from song to song, she says. ""I often write poems and put them together; then a lot of times melodies come first and we write songs to them"". A number like Soukura grew out of the band's bass player, Mawuena Kodjovi, jamming on a bass line from a song he wrote for a musician in Mali, a bass line that she immediately responded to. The next stage was refining and adding material to the song, she says – ""a raw process and then a crafting.""   The band is working on a second album, and they'll be playing some of the new songs in Australia. ""We are first and foremost a live band and you won't understand the Nubatones until you've seen us play. Stories we tell between sets explain a lot,"" she says, including the meaning of lyrics, ""why we wrote things, what we're thinking about and talking about: We do songs for different reasons, depending on what's happening around us.""   She has written some songs in English but she's not ready to perform them yet. ""I really wanted to find my own voice, to know what my Sudanese voice sounded like. And I always knew I had a lot to say in that voice."" Alsarah and the Nubatones are at Howler on Friday March 18 at 8pm. You have reached your maximum number of saved items.
