AgResearch lack of progress on its plan to slash jobs at its Dunedin campus shows it is ‘‘struggling'' to make its business case stack up, Dunedin North MP David Clark says. Dr Clark's comments come as AgResearch yesterday confirmed it submitted its updated business plan to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) in December. The updated case - originally promised by June 30 - was approved by AgResearch's board in October. An MBIE spokeswoman said it was not yet finished considering AgResearch's business case and a separate case for a ""hub'' at Lincoln, which would involve AgResearch and a range of partners. Once this consideration was complete relevant ministers would be briefed. Dr Clark said the fact the business case was yet to be ticked off by Government ministers showed it was struggling to make its case for shifting jobs from Invermay - which is on the outskirts of Mosgiel - to a hub in Lincoln stack up. ""If the Government had a good news story around this they would be shouting from the roof tops. ""Instead they are stuck with a situation where they are trying to manage the consequences of their failure to act in the national interest.'' Dr Clark said problems face by AgResearch's partners in the Lincoln hub -including a downturn in dairy prices and Lincoln University's struggles - made the proposal less viable than ever. An AgResearch spokeswoman said it was not concerned over the length of time the process was taking. ""AgResearch understands that the approval process will require consideration by multiple ministers and ministries and we have factored this into our timetable. ""Following their approval, the business cases will be released,'' she said. Science and innovation minister Steven Joyce said ministers expected to be briefed on the issue soon and took issue with Dr Clark's comments. ""Mr Clark is once again indulging in hyperactive speculation in search of a headline. ""The business cases are simply being reviewed thoroughly. ""As I've said previously in relation to the Lincoln hub, Lincoln University have had to do further work on their part of the hub plan.''
