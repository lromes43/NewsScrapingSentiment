Through March 5: This two-weekend festival brings in an outstanding collection of international musicians to perform several centuries of music from Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. Highly recommended is Friday’s concert by Andalusian early music ensemble Accademia del Piacere, which brings fiery passion and infectious rhythms to old music. Other concerts feature music of Spain’s Sephardic Jews and 20th century art songs from Spain and Argentina. Accademia del Piacere, 7:30 p.m. Friday, St. Mark’s Episcopal Cathedral, 519 Oak Grove St., Mpls.; Sephardic music from Spain, 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Beth El Synagogue, 5225 Barry St. W., St. Louis Park; Nerea Berraondo and Ainhoa Urkijo, 7:30 p.m. March 5, MacPhail Center for Music, 501 Second St., Mpls.; $20-$17; ismfestival.org.
— Rob Hubbard Dance: Contempo Physical Dance  Friday-Saturday: Marciano Silva dos Santos already cut a commanding figure as a towering, graceful dancer with TU Dance before forming his own company, Contempo Physical Dance, a troupe that’s gone on to create athletic, adrenaline-pumping modern dance with strong Afro-Brazilian influences. Silva dos Santos returns to the stage in a revival of his exciting “Batuque” this weekend, but the main event will be the premiere of a new work by Senegalese-French choreographer Patrick Acogny, who has been in town as part of Contempo’s first international residency. Identity, environment and traditional dance gatherings in Senegal help shape his piece, “Cool Play.” 7:30 p.m.; the O’Shaughnessy, St. Catherine University, 2004 Randolph Ave., St. Paul; $25-$15; 651-690-6700 or oshag.stkate.edu. — Rob Hubbard Classical: St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Friday-Sunday: The SPCO’s newest artistic partner, Swedish clarinetist Martin Frost, has canceled his concerts for the rest of this season while being treated for the inner ear affliction, Meniere’s Disease. But that door closing has led to a very exciting one opening. Stepping in this weekend and making his Minnesota debut is French pianist David Fray, who’s been creating a major buzz on both sides of the Atlantic as a colorful, idiosyncratic interpreter of baroque and classical-era repertoire. He’s the soloist for Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 24 on a program that also features Andrew Norman’s “Light Screens” and Aaron Copland’s “Appalachian Spring.” 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday; Ordway Concert Hall, 345 Washington St., St. Paul; $53-$5; 651-291-1144 or thespco.org. — Rob Hubbard Event: Red Bull Crashed Ice and Crashed Ice Village Friday-Saturday: Red Bull Crashed Ice returns to St. Paul for the fifth year this weekend, with skaters in hockey gear hurtling down an ice-coated giant luge-type tube 1,600 feet long with a drop of 12 stories in front of the Cathedral St. Paul. The “ice cross downhill skating competition” Friday and Saturday is expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators. And for the second straight year, Red Bull Crashed Ice attendees can party in the street Saturday at the Crashed Ice Village on West Seventh Street. Nine restaurants and bars on West Seventh between Kellogg Boulevard and Walnut Street will have outdoor bars and food stands. The street will be set up with tents and activities including a snowboard demonstration by athletes from Afton Alps. Metro Transit is offering free rides on buses and light rail with a pass that can be downloaded at visitsaintpaul.com/crashedice. Crashed Ice Village open 2-10:30 p.m. Saturday, West Seventh Street, St. Paul; visitsaintpaul.com/blog/your-guide-to-crashed-ice/. — Kathy Berdan Theater: The Critic / The Real Inspector Hound Opens Friday: Is new Guthrie Theater artistic director Joseph Haj playing to the critics with this twin bill of comedies featuring those hard-working, integrity-filled and — dare I say? — conspicuously good-looking folks who review plays? Perhaps. Or maybe he was just looking for a way to get a pair of short, sharp scripts — one written by the prolific and knighted Tom Stoppard and one adapted by the equally prolific but sadly undubbed Jeffrey Hatcher — onto the Guthrie stage. Through March 27. Guthrie Theater; 818 S. Second St., Minneapolis; $64-$34; 612-377-2224 or guthrietheater.org. — Dominic P. Papatola Hip-hop: Hoodie Allen Friday: The rapper born Steven Adam Markowitz was working for Google when he decided to quit and focus on music full-time. It was a good move, as he quickly found an audience on the Internet with songs that sampled such indie-pop acts as Marina and the Diamonds, Death Cab for Cutie and Two Door Cinema Club. In 2011, he had a strong enough following to tour the U.S. and has since self-released a series of EPs, mixtapes and two full-length albums, including his new one, “Happy Camper.” It hit No. 1 on both the iTunes hip-hop and Billboard’s rap albums charts. 6:30 p.m.; Skyway Theatre, 711 Hennepin Ave., Mpls.; $27.50; 612-333-6100 or skywaytheatre.com. — Ross Raihala Rock: Cannibal Corpse Friday: It’s difficult to understand how anyone would take the horror-movie imagery of Cannibal Corpse seriously. “Eaten Back to Life,” “Gore Obsessed” and “Evisceration Plague” are among the band’s album titles, and lead singer George Fisher goes by the nickname Corpsegrinder. But in the first decade of their career, Cannibal Corpse saw their albums banned in Australia and Germany, while in 1995, Bob Dole accused them of undermining the national character of the United States. For real! They are still around, though, and headline this club bill with Obituary, Cryptopsy and Abysmal Dawn. (The Cabooze also has a similar band, Cradle of Filth, booked at 6 p.m. Sunday. Tickets for the all-ages show are $22.50). 7:30 p.m.; Cabooze, 917 Cedar Ave. S., Mpls.; $25; 612-338-6425 or cabooze.com. — Ross Raihala Rock: Eleanor Friedberger Friday: The brother-and-sister duo of Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger maintained one of the more frustrating careers of the ’00s as the Fiery Furnaces, abruptly changing musical styles and exploring left-field ideas (like the time they recorded that spoken-word album with their elderly grandmother). They went on hiatus in 2011, and now Eleanor returns to town to play songs from her just-released third solo album, “New View.” She says it was influenced by Van Morrison, Neil Young, Yoko Ono and George Harrison, among others. Icewater and Midnight Reruns open. 8 p.m.; Turf Club, 1601 University Ave. W., St. Paul; $14-$12; 651-647-0486 or turfclub.net. — Ross Raihala Dance music: Cherub Friday-Saturday: Nashville electronic duo Cherub met as students at Middle Tennessee State University while studying music promotion. Soon after, they started making music together with the goal to “share a little bit of sex, a little bit of drugs and a whole lot of love” with dance music fans. They have toured heavily, opening for Gramatik and playing major festivals from Lollapalooza to Bonnaroo to Austin City Limits Music Festival. Columbia Records issued the pair’s debut album, “Year of the Caprese,” in 2014, and it’s done so well the pair is back in town to play First Avenue’s main room two nights. Gibbz and Mike Floss open. 8 p.m.; First Avenue, 701 First Ave. N., Mpls.; $20-$17; 612-332-1775 or first-avenue.com. — Ross Raihala Visual Art: Ordinary Pictures  Opens Saturday: You know those generic images that convey everything from tropical paradises to people with big smiles enjoying a healthy salad? Those stock photographs have inspired “Ordinary Pictures,” an exhibit featuring more than 45 artists who have reimagined those images through various media including sculpture, painting, prints and installation. Curated by Eric Crosby, formerly with the Walker and now with the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, “Ordinary Pictures” spans half a century in its examination of a subject most of us are familiar with but probably don’t spend much time thinking about. “The stock image is instantly familiar and circulates invisibly in our lives,” Crosby said in a news press release. “Yet a global industry sustains it by perpetuating the demands of advertisers and consumers alike. I’m interested in how artists can prompt us to look differently at the seemingly banal products of industrial image culture.” Preview party (9 p.m.-midnight Friday; $30) and opening day artist talk with Morgan Fisher (2 p.m. Saturday; free). Exhibit runs through Oct. 9; Walker Art Center, 1750 Hennepin Ave., Mpls.; $14-$9 (free for children under 18 also free every Thursday evening and the first Saturday of the month); 612-375-7600 or walkerart.org. — Amy Carlson Gustafson Jazz: Studio Z Jazz Festival Saturday: Studio Z, the music performance space in Lowertown’s Northwestern Building, will stage its third annual Winter Jazz Festival. Performers include guitarist Dean Magraw and Red Planet (also featuring bassist Chris Bates and drummer Jay Epstein), a solo set by pianist/composer Brian Nichols, trumpeter/composer Adam Meckler and his quintet, a solo set by drummer/percussionist/electronic musician JT Bates, and guitarist Dean Granros and his group Tall Tales (with Epstein, Chris Bates and guitarist Zacc Harris). 4-9 p.m.; Studio Z, 275 E. Fourth St. #200, Northwestern Building second floor, St. Paul; $15; 651-755-1600 or studiozstpaul.com. — Dan Emerson Classical: National Lutheran Choir Saturday-Sunday: Just back from an Upper Midwest tour, one of the jewels in Minnesota’s choral crown performs a program called “Psalms and Spirituals” that will feature Leonard Bernstein’s powerful “Chichester Psalms” and works by Charles Stanford, Brazilian composer Emani Aguiar, Zach Westermeyer, Abbie Betinis and the choir’s conductor, David Cherwien. The featured soloist is Grammy-nominated British countertenor Ryland Angel, who has sung leads at major opera houses in Europe and the U.S. Other guests include organist Aaron David Miller and harpist Rachel Brandwein. 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church, 12650 Johnny Cake Ridge Road, Apple Valley; 4 p.m. Sunday, St. Philip the Deacon Lutheran Church, 17205 County Road 6, Plymouth; $27-$10 (17 and under free); 800-838-3006 or nlca.com. — Rob Hubbard Rock: Coheed and Cambria Saturday: Prog-rock revivalists Coheed and Cambria spent their first decade in the public eye creating a vast sci-fi saga called “The Amory Wars,” which they have told through eight studio albums, a series of comic books and a full-length novel. In 2012, there was even talk of adapting it into a film, although that project seems to have been abandoned. Whatever the case, the group’s latest record, “The Color Before the Sun,” is notable because it’s their first that stands separately from “The Amory Wars” project. On it, the band takes a more traditional alt-rock/metal approach, and while it has alienated some longtime fans, it’s also earned Coheed and Cambria a few new ones. Glassjaw, I the Mighty and Silver Snakes are also on the bill. 6:30 p.m.; Myth, 3090 Southlawn Drive, Maplewood; $27.50 (all ages); 651-779-6984 or mythlive.com. — Ross Raihala Rock: Animal Collective  Sunday: The sound of Baltimore indie rockers Animal Collective is kind of tough to pin down, but they manage to find a psychedelic midway point between Sonic Youth and the Beach Boys, which is no easy feat. The band earned untold amounts of hype for their eighth album, 2009’s “Merriweather Post Pavilion,” which topped that year’s Village Voice Pazz and Jop critics’ poll. Their follow-up, 2012’s “Centipede Hz,” was more experimental and less popular, but their new one, “Painting With,” has regained the trust of those who fell for “Merriweather.” They recorded it, in part, in a studio Brian Wilson used to make “Pet Sounds,” and they got the Velvet Underground’s John Cale to play on the song “Hocus Pocus.” 7 p.m.; First Avenue, 701 First Ave. N., Mpls.; sold out; 612-332-1775 or first-avenue.com. — Ross Raihala Folk: Jane Siberry Sunday: Canadian singer/songwriter Jane Siberry began her career performing relatively straightforward folk music, at first as part of the group Java Jive and then as a solo artist. Her 1981 self-titled debut album earned her the description as a “post-punk Joni Mitchell,” but soon after, Siberry expanded her sound to embrace synthesizers and art rock. She reached her commercial peak with 1993’s “When I Was a Boy” but has continued to record albums on her own Sheeba Records label since 1996. Her latest and first in five years, “Ulysses’ Purse,” features several guests including K.D. Lang and Mary Margaret O’Hara. Local singer/songwriter/ukulele enthusiast Katy Vernon opens. 7:30 p.m.; Cedar Cultural Center, 416 Cedar Ave. S., Mpls.; $30-$25; 612-338-2674 or thecedar.org. — Ross Raihala Rock: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Monday: Bruce Springsteen returns to St. Paul to play the Xcel Energy Center for the 10th time. When we last saw him, during a pair of sold-out shows in November 2012, he had a horn section and choir backing him up. Now, he’s got a more stripped-down band on the road, although this is Springsteen we’re talking about, so he will be joined on stage by nine musicians. They are playing his 1980 double album “The River” in full to tie in with a recent deluxe reissue. He’s also finding time to work in about a dozen other songs from his back catalog. Each night of the tour is being recorded and released via live.brucespringsteen.net as high-quality downloads and on CD. 7:30 p.m.; Xcel Energy Center, 175 W. Kellogg Blvd., St. Paul; $152.50-$57.50; 800-745-3000 or xcelenergycenter.com. — Ross Raihala Folk: Rickie Lee Jones Monday-Tuesday: In the 37 years since “Chuck E’s in Love” made her an instant Bohemian star, Rickie Lee Jones has rarely taken the easy or predictable path with her career, veering into jazz, pop standards and even trip-hop. In 2012, she told a reporter she was suffering from writer’s block, which is why she has released two cover albums in recent years. But a move to New Orleans gave Jones fresh inspiration for her latest record, “The Other Side of Desire.” She told Uncut magazine: “I get tired of abstract ideas and talking about myself. I wanted something concrete. I came here and made a new life. There is nowhere like this in the world.” 8 p.m.; Dakota Jazz Club, 1010 Nicollet Ave., Mpls.; $60-$45; 612-332-1010 or dakotacooks.com. — Ross Raihala Folk: Carrie Rodriguez  Tuesday: Singer/songwriter Carrie Rodriguez hails from Texas but clearly has taken a shine to the Twin Cities’ pool of talent. She has collaborated with a long line of locals, including Gary Louris, Dan Wilson and Jim Boquist, and she’s toured with Romantica and the band’s lead singer Luke Jacobs. She now calls Jacobs “my duo partner in crime,” and he plays guitar on her new album, “Lola.” On “Lola,” Rodriguez sings in English, Spanish and a blend of the two, tackling her own material and the works of several of her favorite Mexican composers. Locals the Roe Family Singers open. 7:30 p.m.; Cedar Cultural Center, 416 Cedar Ave. S., Mpls.; $20-$18; 612-338-2674 or thecedar.org. — Ross Raihala Dance: Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Tuesday: Alvin Ailey founded his modern dance company in 1958, and soon it was one of American dance’s most significant companies. The New York City-based troupe has become an international arts ambassador, regularly touring to several states and countries. It’s also the keeper of the unique choreographic vision of Ailey, who created masterful works examining the experiences of African-Americans before his death in 1989. Two of his works will be performed at its Northrop stop, including the legendary “Revelations” from 1960, as well as his tribute to his mother, “Cry.” Also on the program are Ronald K. Brown’s “Open Door” and Rennie Harris’ recent hip-hop celebration, “Exodus.” 7:30 p.m.; Northrop, 84 Church St. S.E., Mpls.; $74-$10; 612-624-2345 or Northrop.umn.edu. — Rob Hubbard Jazz: Brian Blade and the Fellowship Wednesday-Thursday: Led by innovative drummer/composer Brian Blade, the Fellowship Band is one of the longest-running combos in jazz. Blade, pianist John Cowherd and bassist Chris Thomas have played together for two decades. Saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler have played with the group since 2000. Blade and his quintet released their fourth album, “Landmarks” (Blue Note Records), in 2014. The versatile Blade has also drummed for some major names, including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Wayne Shorter, Seal, Bill Frisell and Emmylou Harris. 7 and 9 p.m.; Dakota Jazz Club and Restaurant, 1010 Nicollet Ave., Mpls.; $32 (early), $22 (late); 612-332-5299 or dakotacooks.com. — Dan Emerson Copyright 2026 Twin Cities.
