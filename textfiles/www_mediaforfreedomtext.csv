expressed serious concern today over security measures adopted last week
 by the police chiefs of five European countries, which he warned are 
already negatively impacting the human rights of refugees and migrants 
in southern and central Europe and compounding the “already 
exceptionally difficult situation” in Greece. Urging the five countries that adopted the measures – Austria, Croatia, 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia – to 
“carefully recalibrate” the approach of their police forces, UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein emphasized that the 
measures are exacerbating “the chaos and misery all down the line,” and 
especially in Greece, which is already overwhelmed. “Alarmingly, given the primary duty of the police to protect people, the
 agreement contains no measures aiming at protecting these extremely 
vulnerable women, children and men on the move – there is, for example, 
not even a mention of special measures to protect people who might be 
particularly at risk of human rights violations, including children, 
persons with disabilities, LGBT persons, older people, victims of 
torture or victims of gender-based violence or trafficking,” Mr. Zeid 
said in a statement. “Instead, the agreement appears to be solely concerned with applying 
stringent limitations of entry on people travelling along the so-called 
Balkan Land Route, and providing for the 'controlled transfer of 
migrants,' without sufficient safeguards,” he added. The adoption of the police measures this past week followed the 
announcement by the Government of Austria of limitations both on the 
number of refugees to be accepted in 2016, and on the number of people 
who will be allowed to transit the country. The latest reports suggest chain deportations are now taking place all 
the way down the Balkan land route, which includes Austria, Slovenia, 
Croatia, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, towards 
Greece, Mr. Zeid said. In addition, hundreds of Afghans were reportedly stranded for more than 
five days on the border between the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia and Serbia, and many other Afghans have been blocked from 
entering the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from Greece, 
apparently solely on the basis of their nationality, he said. Mr. Zeid also regretted certain authorities' reported refusal of entry 
to any people arriving at their borders, if they were unable to produce 
the documents specified in the agreement. Whether someone possesses a 
particular document has no bearing on whether they are a refugee, he 
said, adding that the lack of a valid document should never be a reason 
for refusing entry into an asylum procedure. “I understand the challenge facing the authorities in some European 
countries who are trying to cope with large numbers of migrants arriving
 on, or transiting, their territory, and efforts to improve the 
management of the situation would be very welcome indeed.” Mr. Zeid 
said. “However, this extraordinary agreement by police chiefs 
establishes a policy across five states that includes measures which 
seem to be incompatible with the human rights obligations of the 
countries concerned, all of which are bound by international human 
rights and refugee law.” Noting that he was “particularly troubled” that the agreement appears to
 enable the collective expulsion of non-nationals – acts explicitly 
prohibited under international law – Mr. Zeid said the prohibition 
against collective expulsion entitles every non-national to an 
individualized examination of all the arguments used against his or her 
removal. Moreover, an integral element of the right to protection from 
collective expulsion and the right of access to an effective remedy is 
that an expulsion is stayed until its compliance with international 
human rights law has been finally determined. Mr. Zeid also said the agreement by the five countries appears to 
authorize profiling people and limiting “entry on humanitarian grounds,”
 solely on the basis of their nationality and possession of 
identification documents, rather than on an individual assessment of 
whether or not they are in need of asylum or some other form of 
international protection of their human rights. The agreement also establishes “extremely narrow criteria” for allowing 
entry – “fleeing war” – with no mention of “persecution,” which is the 
key criteria for recognizing refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention 
and its 1967 Protocol and related international law, Mr. Zeid stressed. He added that the “narrow focus” also appears to invalidate a number of 
other legitimate grounds according to which a person may be permitted to
 enter another State's territory under international and European human 
rights law. Mr. Zeid noted the repeated calls by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR)
 and the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois
 Crépeau, to the European Union (EU) to halt the continuous regression 
of the human rights of refugees and migrants. He also urged the EU and other European countries to “take steps to 
counter the myth-making, stereotyping, racism and xenophobia which have 
so distorted and politicized the migration debate, undermining efforts 
to govern the movements of refugees and migrants in rational ways that 
both protect their rights and ease the management challenges the whole 
of Europe is facing.” Copyright mediaforfreedo.com"
