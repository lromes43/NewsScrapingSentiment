2016-02-26,"Suit you sir: David Cameron(Image: Getty) How magnificent it was to behold David Cameron tearing into Jeremy Corbyn for being unkempt and unpatriotic. How revealing to see the carefully constructed facade crumble, the snarl appear and the real Cameron look down at the Labour leader like something brown and sticky he’d found on the sole of his Savile Row brogue. “My mother would say: ‘Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem’,” he spat like an Old Etonian roasting his fag for bringing him crumpets without wearing a bow tie. Here was the bullying elitist unplugged from his PR machine, his inner Lord Snooty released. The aristocrat who believes he was born to sit at the top of a class system (just under his distant cousin, The Queen) and everyone below should polish their forelock and tug it in the presence of their betters.

How do you like your suit, sir? Off the peg, sir? Or maybe in the pig, sir? Do you like to feed it into the pig’s face, sir? Do you sir? Do you? Ooh, suits you, sir.” It may have cancelled out the raucous cheers coming from the Tory benches, delighted that the wimp who’d gone soft on Brussels was dropping the PC garbage and speaking their lingo. And with more Old Etonians around him than any leader since Harold Macmillan, and 50% of his Cabinet educated at fee-paying schools, he certainly was. That last figure came from a shocking report published this week by the Sutton Trust, which showed that public school pupils have a stranglehold on every key profession in Britain. Despite only 7% of the population being educated privately, 71% of top military officers, 74% of top judges, 61% of the country’s top doctors, 42% of top actors and 32% of MPs received paid-for educations. It gets even worse when you look at how many Oxford and Cambridge graduates hold key positions: They educate less than 1% of the population, but 74% of the top judiciary, 54% of the country’s leading journalists and 47% of the Cabinet got their degrees there. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, concluded that private schools were providing a massive leg-up in the world and “the key to improving social mobility is to open up independent schools to all pupils based on merit, not money.” Good luck with that. Public schools’ biggest attraction to many parents is that it keeps out the riff-raff. It allows them to mix with equally wealthy professional families thus cultivating crucial contacts. It’s a huge masonic club. You get my son an internship in your law practice and I’ll get your daughter one in my publishing firm. POLLIs David Cameron right about Jeremy Corbyn's dress senseIs David Cameron right about Jeremy Corbyn's dress senseYes Jezza does look a bit trampyNo, the PM should keep his snout out Meanwhile, kids without contacts or money, and from outside London, no matter how bright, are effectively excluded because they can’t afford £1,000-a-month to survive in unpaid internships in one of the dearest cities on Earth. And so the public school grip tightens. Our PM knows this better than anyone. He secured his first political job after an anonymous call from a family friend in Buckingham Palace. And now, as he leaves office so doesn’t have to pretend any more, he’s sending his kids to private schools. That Corbyn insult was no accident. Cameron knows doing up your old school tie is what a chap does to get on. It’s also strangling this country. But, ooh, how that suits him, sir.
