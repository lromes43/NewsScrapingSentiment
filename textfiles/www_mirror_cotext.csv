2016-02-26,"Beer we go: Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Nobby in Grimsby Having offended Middle East despots, suburban rappers, gay models and everyone in Kazakhstan, Sacha Baron Cohen turns his fire on the British working-class male. His brand of venomous, bad-taste humour is unlikely to endear him to anyone with a fondness for lager and football – but, blimey, is the comedian’s new satire a hoot. The writer-producer-star plays the lager-swilling Norman ‘Nobby’ Grimsby who lives in the Lincolnshire fishing town with his sex-crazed wife Lindsey ( Rebel Wilson ) and their nine children (whose names include Skeletor and Django Unchained). When not engaged in football hooliganism, getting falling-down drunk or sticking fireworks up his behind, Nobby is gleefully cheating the benefits system by claiming to have leukaemia. He’s the kind of yobbo to give the Tory party a collective heart attack and who makes the Viz comic character, Sid The Sexist, look positively enlightened. But Nobby has a secret – namely that, as an orphan, he was separated from his brother, Sebastian, who now, 28 years later, turns out to be an 007-like MI6 spy. Reunited, the pair team up to foil a plot by a sinister global terrorist (Penelope Cruz) to wipe out the world’s working classes. The cast also includes Ian McShane, Tamsin Egerton and Baron Cohen’s real-life wife, Isla Fisher. You can see why the good people of Grimsby – “twinned with Chernobyl” – are so upset, with their town portrayed as a deprived (and depraved) collection of raggedy, litter-strewn sink estates whose residents are uniformly fat, chain-smoking troglodytes. Read more: Sacha Baron Cohen owes Grimsby more than a few laughs and a dodgy accent Still, it’s a good bet the people we’re meant to be laughing at will be able to laugh with us thanks to no end of humour that remains shocking, vile and top-notch throughout. While much of it can’t be repeated here, a scene where Nobby and Sebastian get trapped up an elephant’s back passage might be the funniest thing you’ve seen since Baron Cohen’s other creation, Borat, engaged in a nude man-on-man wrestling match. Amid the welter of other gags, mostly revolving around body fluids, there’s also a humdinger involving Donald Trump, Daniel Radcliffe and the Aids virus. No, really. Grimsby (which has been renamed The Brothers Grimsby in the US) may not hit the heights of Baron Cohen’s earlier efforts (Borat, The Dictator, TV’s Da Ali G Show and the underrated Bruno) but it shows his gift for satire remains alive and well. Prepare to be entertained, shocked and offended in equal measure. Best quote: Lindsey to Nobby, “Who’s the man who can get me pregnant without even waking me up?” Best bit: That elephant scene. Worst bit: Not everyone in Grimsby will get the joke. If you liked... The Dictator, Spy, Kingsman: The Secret Service ...
