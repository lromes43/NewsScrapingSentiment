2016-02-26,"While the rest of the men’s team won’t join junior diver Josiah Purss for another week at the Pac-12 Championships, it doesn’t hurt to give his team a head start. On Thursday, in the second day of competition, Purss finished in third place in the one-meter diving event with a score of 385.50, while teammates Jacob Crayne and Connor Cain took fifth and 11th place, respectively. Meanwhile, the women’s team finished the day in seventh place overall with 210 points. Stanford leads the event with 557 points, while USC and Cal round out the top three. Earlier in the day, the women’s diving team took to the three-meter event, where junior Amanda Casillas placed 12th with 275.05 points and sophomore Lauren Hall placed 17th with 255.35 points to round out the strong diving efforts from both Utah teams. “It was exciting to have Jake and Josiah both trying for a conference championship today,” said head diving coach Richard Marschner in a press release. “We were the only school with two guys in the top five, and it marks the third year in a row that we’ve had a medalist on one-meter. Amanda [Casillas] and Lauren [Hall] did a great job to score points for the team, and this was the highest finish either of them have had on three-meter at this meet.” To start off individual races for swimming, freshmen Jordan Anderson and sophomore Kat Wickham competed in the 500-yard freestyle, both managing to place in C-finals. Anderson grabbed 18th (4:49.10) in a close race, as Wickham squeaked in at 24th (4:56.17). In the 50-yard freestyle, sophomore Jenna Marsh and freshman Gillian St. John battled against each other during finals, with Marsh just out-touching St. John. Marsh managed to snag 20th with a time of 22.92 seconds, while St. John took 21st in 22.96 seconds. In the only relay of the day, the team of Marsh, St. John, junior Rhianna Williams and sophomore Dorien Butter snagged eighth place above Oregan State with a time of 1:31.70. Tomorrow, the Pac-12 conference meet will continue with Session 5 beginning at 11 a.m. PT, with finals following at 6 p.m. PT.
