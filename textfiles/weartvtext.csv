The damage survey officially rates the Tuesday night northwest Florida tornado as an EF-3. The National Weather Service Mobile office reports that prior to 2016 there were only three F-3 tornadoes recorded in Escambia County, Florida. These were rated on the old F scale since the EF scale was not introduced until 2007. These incredibly strong tornadoes were recorded in 1971, 1967 and 1956. In Escambia County the storm first touched down between Washington High School and Creighton Road according to the data point on the National Weather Service map.  From there it grew in strength and was rated at different points as an EF-1, EF-2 and EF-3 tornado. As seen by the damage, the tornado reached its peak over the Moorings apartments and continued causing major damage until it moved over Escambia Bay. Debris was carried across the bay and was found on the Santa Rosa County shoreline. EF-1 damage is being reported in a few spots of Santa Rosa County in Pace. The tornado had a peak wind of 155mph, was 300 yards wide, and had a path length of 8 miles. To read the full report from the National Weather Service team, click here:  2026 Sinclair, Inc."
