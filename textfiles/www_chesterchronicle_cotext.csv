2016-02-26,"Olivia Treeby in her new specialist car seat A Chester four-year-old facing major surgery will be able to travel pain-free, thanks to a new specialist car seat funded through a charity partnership. Olivia Treeby from Hoole has abnormal flexed hip sockets and needs specialist footwear to walk. In order to travel in the family car Olivia needed a specialist car seat to provide essential support after her operation. The Dorin Park pupil had been travelling in a standard car seat, but this was not suitable as it would not accommodate her Hip Spica, which is a type of plaster that covers both legs from the ankles up to her stomach, so she can be comfortable on journeys. Mum Nicole Luijnenburg said: “Because of Olivia’s hip dysplasia she needs to be comfortable. She was growing out of her rear facing car seat, it was quite narrow putting pressure onto her hips. After the surgery she needs a seat with enough room so the healing process can take place without any added pressure from a small car seat.” With the specialist equipment costing £665 and no statutory funding available, Olivia’s family turned to Newlife Foundation – the UK’s leading charity funder of specialist equipment for children with disabilities and terminal illness. Olivia Treeby in her new specialist car seat Thanks to funding from the Morgan Foundation, Olivia is now travelling in her new specialist car seat which will support her as she grows. Nicole added: “We’d like to say a huge thank you to Newlife and the Morgan Foundation for funding Olivia’s car seat, we really appreciate all the help.” The Morgan Foundation is working with Newlife to ensure more children with disabilities and terminal illness get the right equipment at the right time. This includes wheelchairs, buggies and walkers for mobility, specialist car seats and beds for safety and a range of other disability equipment including communication aids, walking frames, portable hoists and seating systems. A fundraising golf day and gala dinner in support of Newlife held last year raised £450,000 to provide vital specialist equipment specifically for families across North Wales, Merseyside, West Cheshire, North Shropshire and parts of the West Midlands. Chairman of The Morgan Foundation Steve Morgan said: “Having a vital aid like this means the health prospects and enjoyment of children like Olivia can be improved. Everyone who took part in our golf day or attended the gala dinner has helped – and will continue to help – make a real difference.” To find out more about Newlife Foundation for Disabled Children and how to access its services, call the Newlife Nurse Helpline on 0800 902 0095 (free from UK landlines) or go to www.newlifecharity.co.uk.
