2016-02-26,"That’s it for the blog today. Thanks for following this week and hope you’ve enjoyed reading all of the content on getreading. Enjoy the rest of your evening and the live blog returns first thing Monday morning at 6.30am! Reading Girls’ School has gone into special measures following an Ofsted report which has described it as “inadequate” in every category. The school in Northumberland Avenue has slumped dramatically from a “good” inspection in January 2012. A total of 10 people are currently on Berkshire’s most wanted list. Five of these are men and women who are wanted by Thames Valley Police following crimes across Reading, Wokingham and Bracknell. Very slow traffic on A327 Shinfield Road in both directions at B3350 Elm Road. You’ll be struggling to keep your feet on the ground at Reading’s newest attraction. Atom Trampoline Park in Gillette Way, south Reading, officially opens its doors on Friday, March 4 at 3pm. In a week which saw Reading start work on their new state-of-the-art training complex at Bearwood Park - I thought it would be apt to switch the spotlight to the club’s academy. This evening Reading’s Under-18s head to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea in the FA Youth Cup quarter-final (7pm kick-off). It’s a game which will see them start as underdogs, but they will travel to west London with no fear. Queueing traffic on A4 Bath Road in both directions at Pincents Lane / Dorking Way, congestion on A4 Bath Road to Langley Hill and on A4 Bath Road to A340 / Wigmore Lane / The Green. In the roadworks area.Long queues through Theale towards the M4 J12. The family of the man who died at Didcot Power Station have paid tribute to a “much loved husband, father, granddad, son, brother and friend”. Mick Collings was working at Didcot and died after caught in the collapse of the power station as it was being demolished. Ahead of the eagerly anticipated in/out referendum we have taken a look at eight things EU funding has done for Reading. A dying man who recently saw his benefits slashed is delighted with all the donations he has received and may soon spend the money on life-lengthening treatment, according to his friend.  A girl who alleges she was molested by her primary school headmaster asked her friend if she remembered him being “creepy” during their school days, a court heard yesterday. There is congestion on Bath Road outside Sainsbury’s in Calcot as there is only one lane open in the roadworks area. There is queueing traffic on the A4 Bath Road in both directions at Pincents Lane and congestion up to the M4 Junction 12 (Theale) due to roadworks. The A4 Bath Road eastbound is partially blocked due to an accident involving four vehicles at Bostock Lane. South East Water is in the process of fixing the problem in Downshire Way, Bracknell. Hugh Fort has given his thoughts on the much berated Bracknell and why it’s not so bad. Yesterday was the topping out of the Marks and Spencers building in Bracknell. One of the underpasses in Bracknell has flooded this morning, believed to be the one nearest to Morrison’s. Possibly due to a burst pipe. More to follow. Now for the weather. I’m guessing today will be ever-so-slightly warmer than the previous days as I didn’t have to scrape my car this morning (\o/). At the moment it’s an almost tropical 1C. This will improve minutely as the day goes on rising to the dizzy highs of 6C this afternoon. Is that warm enough to eat lunch outside? Sunrise will be at 6.56am and it will take off its hat and set at 5.38pm. It going to be fairly cloudy today, there is a possibility of rain at around 2pm but in my professional opinion (as someone who writes a live blog) you probably won’t get wet. It’s Friday everyone! It’s almost the weekend, so near I can almost taste the lie-in. Welcome back to getreading this Friday February morning, I’m going to assume you’re here for the live blog? No? Tough. This is the live blog. It’s all the breaking news from across Reading and the surrounding boroughs. I’ll also endeavour to keep you all informed of the travel situation in and around the towns. Spoiler for later: Cemetery junction is busy. There will be highlights from around the site, maybe some fun from Twitter and Charles Watts’ musings on the up coming Reading FC game.
