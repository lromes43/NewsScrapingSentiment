2016-03-02,"Manager Joe Royle says he will wait on the fitness of striker Shefki Kuqi ahead of Saturday's top of the table clash at Wigan. The Finnish international is convinced he will be OK to play some role at the JJB Stadium. Royle said: ""Shefki certainly thinks he has a chance and we haven't totally given up on him. He will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness. ""But he still hasn't played football since the injury and I have a couple of ideas in my head as to what we will do at Wigan if he doesn't make it."" Kuqi himself is hassling Town's medical staff to give him the go-ahead: ""Things are improving all the time and I know I'm a quick healer, but it's the first time I've had an injury like this and I know it has to be properly healed inside before I can start playing again. ""I feel I am ready to go and do this and do that but these guys know their job and I have to be guided by what they say."" Kuqi picked up the gash to his thigh in the 2-1 win against Leicester. In his absence the Blues have picked up just one point from three games. Town are also without James Scowcroft on Saturday as the loanee is suspended after reaching five bookings. If Kuqi fails to make it into the starting line-up he may be on the bench with Spaniard Pablo Couñago and Dean Bowditch amongst Royle's attacking options. Midfielder Darren Currie could also be used as a striker. Town's lack of frontmen could also mean that youngsters Darryl Knights and Billy Clarke might be in with a shout at a place on the bench. There will be no Jason De Vos for Town at Wigan, the former Latic unable to face his old side having also reached five bookings. Loanee David Unsworth looks likely to move into the middle with Matt Richards or Danny Karbassiyoon coming in at left-back. Manager Royle has revealed that last season's Player of the Year Ian Westlake will be recalled to the starting line-up against the Lancastrians. Photo: Action Images via Reuters"
