(NYA Times staff photos by Adam Gruenewald) by ADAM GRUENEWALD NYA Times Cologne Academy theater is hoping to bring a big show production to its new venue with their upcoming play, “Bye Bye Birdie.” The satire on American society and Elvis Presley set in 1958, “Bye Bye Birdie” features rock singer Conrad Birdie who travels to a small Ohio town to make his farewell television performance and kiss his biggest fan before he is drafted. Cast members have been rehearsing for their upcoming production since just after winter break in early January for the musical, according to Missy Isles, one of several directors of the play, based on the 1960 Broadway production and 1963 film, based on the book by Michael Stewart, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. Isles said rehearsals have been going well, despite the limited two months of preparation. The play is the third for Cologne Academy as Isles and fellow music teacher Helen Suhr have put on “Princess Whatsername” and “There’s a Monster in My Closet” in the past two years. One of the highlights of this year’s play is sure to be the use of the new stage as part of the Cologne Academy expansion phase, according to Isles. The lighting and full curtains has given Isles and other directors the opportunity to put on the big show, as they are no longer restricted by sets and props as much as when they were performing at the Cologne Community Center. “It’s very cool,” said Isles. “We can do a lot things here that we couldn’t. It’s really nice to have our own dedicated space. It just seems like an amazing thing.” In addition, Isles said students have benefited from the stage, heightening the experience not only with usages of “downstage” and “upstage” but also enhancing the performances. “The kids have gotten used to it really quickly,” she said. “They see it and they get it and they work well in the space.” “Bye Bye Birdie” is a show that is sure to engage the audience with recognizable music choreographed by first grade teacher Kelly Peterson, bright costumes designed by sixth grade teacher Leann Carnell and others and sets purchased, donated by families and also constructed by Brian Isles. “It’s our first show in an awesome new space,” said Isles. “We have to make it something memorable, recognizable and something big. We want people to come in and see the awesome things that our kids can do in this space.” The cast and crew of about 50 fifth- through eighth-graders is highlighted in brief by several familiar participants like Isabelle Hoese as Kim McAfee, Sophie Sazdoff as Mrs. Peterson, Monte Diedrick as Albert, Benny Crowder as Conrad Birdie and Kathryn Jans as Rosie Alvarez. “Everybody is really involved in the show and it’s really fast-paced,” said Isles. Isles said some of the three-time Cologne Academy theater department is helping to grow the program for the future by incorporatng younger students. “It’s cool to see the older kids mentor the younger kids and really help them see what it’s all about,” said Isles.
