2016-03-02,"A dolphin washed up on a beach Foreign-registered supertrawlers are being blamed for a rise in the number of dead dolphins washing up on Ireland's west coast since the start of the year. The Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG) said that in the first two months of this year, there were 28 strandings of common dolphins, the second-highest number ever recorded. Marine scientists with the group said the bulk of the strandings took place in north-western coastal areas of Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, with evidence showing that many of the dolphins got caught up in large fishing nets. The highest-recorded total for common dolphins for the same two months was 2013, when 31 were recorded by experts at the IWDG. In comparison, just two common dolphin strandings were reported in the first two months of 2010, while there were three strandings in the comparable period for 2009.  But IWDG chiefs said they fear the recorded number of strandings so far this year may only be a “small percentage” of the actual number of dead animals. Mick O’Connell, IWDG strandings officer, said: “Many of the dolphins found recently, particularly in counties Mayo, Sligo, and Donegal, show obvious signs of being caught in fishing nets. “This trend of a huge increase in strandings of common dolphins on the northwest coast during January and February is ongoing since 2011."" While there is no conclusive proof of what vessels are involved, the evidence points to the presence of large (c100m) foreign-registered freezer trawlers, fishing in Irish waters. Mr O'Connell added: “While small numbers of stranded dolphins showing signs of bycatch [marine species caught unintentionally] have been occasionally recorded from around the coast previously, we have never seen anything like the scale of the now apparently annual carnage on our northwest coast. “It is important to remember that the number of bycaught dolphins that actually get washed ashore and recorded as stranded may only be a small percentage of the actual number of dead animals.” Although regularly encountered around the Irish coast, there is evidence that populations of the species are in decline - succumbing to the same threats that affect so many cetacean species, like entanglement in fishing gear, chemical and noise pollution, human disturbance, habitat loss and the depletion of prey species by over-fishing. In a report on the IWDG website, Mr O’Connell added: “We believe it is time to have observers placed on these large vessels to monitor the species and number of bycaught animals with a view to introducing mitigation measures to reduce the impact on non-target species from both a conservation and welfare point of view.” At  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.
