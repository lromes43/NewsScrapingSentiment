2016-02-26,"TONIGHT’S MUST-SEE: “In Performance at the White House,” 9 p.m., PBS. (check local listings) Some truly great talents, old and (mostly) young, combine to perform the music of Ray Charles. Paired with a Fats Domino profile (see below), that gives PBS a night of splendid sounds. The weekend ahead, on your TV set The White House concert, taped Wednesday, was scheduled to include Usher, plus Sam Moore, 80 (of Sam & Dave fame), gospel’s Yolanda Adams and lots of emerging stars. That includes Jussie Smollett (of “Empire”), Demi Lovato, Andra Day, Leon Bridges, The Band Perry and Brittany Howard. TONIGHT’S MIGHT-SEE: “Vampire Diaries” and “The Originals,” 8 and 9 p.m., CW. These crossover episodes were set in motion last week when Rayna Cruz, a fierce vampire hunter, reached Mystic Falls (the “Diaries” home). Now Stefan tries to lure her to New Orleans, where the “Originals” people may or may not be able to protect him. Once he arrives, he finds he might be crucial to the survival of Freya and her brothers. Klaus and Elijah can’t help, because they’re stuck inside a magical trap. TONIGHT’S ALTERNATIVE: “American Masters,” 10 p.m., PBS (check local listings). Most “Masters” hours trace the wild twists and turns in complicated lives. Not this time: Fats Domino’s personal life has been remarkably straight-ahead: He was born in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward and remained there with his wife and 13 children. After Hurricane Katrina, friends rebuilt his home there. With few personality quirks to follow, this hour focuses on great music, via TV and movie clips. Before rock music had a name, Domino played it; before Elvis Presley had a hit, Domino had several. Other choices include: “The Amazing Race,” 8 p.m., CBS. This has been tough on the two-generation teams. In the opener, Dr. Scott Fowler and his daughter Blair were last ... and lucky to be in a non-elimination week; in the second episode, Marty Cobb (known for her flight-attendant video) and her daughter Hagan Parkman finished last and were dumped. Now the 10 surviving duos retrieve a clue from Colombian catacombs. “Last Man Standing,” 8 p.m., ABC. Here’s another reunion of the “Home Improvement” stars. Mike (Tim Allen) is determined to get the miniature tanks that were owned by a neighbor; alas, the guy’s widow (Patricia Richardson, Allen’s former TV wife) has already sold them. “Inside Out,” 8-9:40 p.m., Starz. Two days before the Academy Awards, catch this gem. It’s nominated for its script — filled with wit for kids or grown-ups — and as best animated feature. “Dr. Ken,” 8:31 p.m., ABC. There’s a conflict of interest, when Allison (Ken’s wife) realizes their daughter is dating the son of one of her psychiatry patients. She also suspects the boy is cheating ... which leads to a revelation about the early days of the Ken-Allison romance. “Second Chance,” 9 p.m., Fox. Things get complicated when you return to life in a different body. Pritchard learns his daughter is dating the guy she knew in high school. He didn’t like the kid then ... and finds him immersed in a new crisis now. “Hawaii Five-0,” 9 p.m., CBS. In previous episodes, Michael Imperioli (“The Sopranos”) played Odell Martin, an ex-con barber. Tonight, McGarrett asks him to help an informant accused of murder. “Blue Bloods,” 10 p.m., CBS. Erin ponders a former mentor, a judge handing out unfair rulings since he was widowed. Her brother Danny tries to help his wife’s co-worker, who has an angry ex-husband. And their dad, the police commissioner, faces an angry city council chief (Whoopi Goldberg)."
