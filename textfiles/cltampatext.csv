Credit: Jersey Mike's Subs via FacebookNext month, Jersey Mike's Subs, a casual sandwich franchise with more than 100 locations across the state, will give back to the community one sub at a time. The restaurant brand has partnered with 180-plus charities nationwide, including a few in Tampa Bay, for its 6th Annual March Month of Giving. The fundraising campaign, which encourages sub lovers to donate to these partner charities at their local Jersey Mike's, will build up to March 30's Day of Giving, when all Jersey Mike's sales will go directly to the partners. Camp Hopetáke, a collaboration between Tampa General Hospital and Tampa Firefighters Local 754, will work with 13 restaurants around Tampa/St. Petersburg. Five restaurants in Clearwater/St. Petersburg have teamed up with JDRF, and the Florida Gulf Coast Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association will benefit from six restaurants in Sarasota/Bradenton. Last year, the Month of Giving raised more than $3 million. In a news release, Jersey Mike's founder and CEO Peter Cancro said the company hopes to raise more than $3.5 million this time around.

Since 1988, Creative Loafing has been Tampa Bay's free, independent voice and we want to keep it that way—so in 2026 a group of employees joined two new partners to buy the paper and make it locally-owned for the first time since 2009. We want to expand our coverage of local news, food, nightlife, events, and culture with no paywalls through our new Tampa Bay Journalism Project initiative. Pitch in today because you love this community, too. Get Creative Loafing Tampa Bay's things-to-do newsletter every Thursday  Creative Loafing Tampa Bay633 N.
