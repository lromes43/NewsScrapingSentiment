2016-02-26,"Five days after a green corridor was set up from Aurangabad to Pune for a liver transplant at Ruby Hall Clinic, a similar exercise was conducted Friday afternoon. Traffic authorities set up the green corridor from government hospital Aurangabad to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital and a liver was transported in three and-a-half hours for the transplant operation. “We faced a challenging situation today as there were at least 25 traffic signals from Wagholi to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital,” Sarang Awhad, DCP Traffic told The Indian Express. On Sunday, the green corridor had helped bring the liver in three hours owing to less traffic. “However today we had to ensure traffic coordination so that the ambulance reached the hospital within minutes. It took 19 minutes to cover a distance of 17.03 km,” Awhad said. “There was perfect coordination among traffic authorities at Aurangabad and Ahmednagar and once the team of doctors reached the outskirts of Pune at Wagholi, the Pune traffic department took over,” he said. Jay Jadhav, Superintendent of Police (Rural), helped coordinate the green corridor where the ambulance with a police escort vehicle could move without any traffic snarls. A 27-year-old man had suffered a head injury in a road accident at Aurangabad and was admitted to the government hospital. This is the first such case at a government hospital when the team was able to retrieve the liver (that was sent to Pune), heart that was sent to a hospital in Chennai and the kidney that was sent to hospital at Aurangabad, Sudheer Kulkarni, Secretary of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee, Aurangabad told The Indian Express. At Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, transplant coordinator Shilpa Barve said they received a call about the liver being available for a transplant on Thursday evening. “Our team of surgeons included Dr Ninad Deshmukh, Dr Vrushali Patil and others. Dr Ninad Deshmukh went with a team to Aurangabad Friday morning and it was at 2 pm that they left the government hospital and reached Deenanath hospital by 5.23 pm,” Barve said. The recipient is a man in his 50’s ailing from end stage liver disease, she said. Aarti Gokhale, central coordinator of ZTCC, Pune said there was a waiting list of at least 65 persons suffering from end stage liver disease that required transplants. “Once we counsel the donor’s family and get their willingness the entire operation is activated and the traffic authorities help us in this effort,” Gokhale added. At Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director told The Indian Express that this was the second liver transplant operation at the hospital. “The operation is still underway . We are grateful to the donor’s family and our team has worked round the clock to retrieve the liver and now perform the transplant,” he said.
