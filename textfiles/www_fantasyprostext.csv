2016-02-26,"Kristaps Porzingis has averaged a fantasy point per minuted played so far this season Here’s a look at DraftKings lineup advice for Friday, Feb. 26 DFS contests. Win up to $10,000 tonight in DraftKings NBA Super Sharpshooter contest Mike Conley (MEM): $7,200 vs. LAL (Proj. Pts – 36.78)
This is the very perfect spot to play Conley. Not only have the Lakers allowed the most fantasy points to opposing point guards of any team in the league, the Grizzlies are essentially missing a whole team’s worth of players. Mike Conley has become more of a scorer, and he showed his ability to put the ball in the basket in the Grizzlies’ most recent matchup with the Lakers. He had a fantastic line with 24 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and a steal. I see no reason why he shouldn’t repeat that performance. Monta Ellis (IND): $6,000 vs. CHA (Proj. Pts – 36.23)
Ellis has turned in 5x-6x points per dollar on these prices in three of his last four games. The Charlotte Hornets have allowed the eighth-most fantasy points per game to opposing shooting guards and ranks 26th against the shooting guard position in spite of playing a below average pace this season. Very safe play in cash games. Chandler Parsons (DAL): $6,200 vs. DEN (Proj. Pts – 38.73)
He is averaging 19.0 points per game over the last five contests. I expect him to bounce back Friday against the Nuggets. With the playoffs just around the corner, it’s these types of games that the Mavs should be winning to climb up the rankings. Good play in all formats. Kristaps Porzingis (NYK): $6,500 vs. ORL (Proj. Pts – 39.21)
He is averaging a fantasy point per minute since the moment he stepped on an NBA court. The Magic have struggled against power forwards this season allowing the eighth-most fantasy points per game to the position. Plus, Orlando may be a little tired from Thursday night’s loss. Marcin Gortat (WAS): $6,700 vs. PHI (Proj. Pts – 34.99)
He is having a very nice season and is one of the more reliable fantasy centers around the league. The 76ers are allowing 106.5 points on 46.2 percent shooting plus they rank 24th against the center position. I’m feeling great if he’s in my 50/50 lineups tonight. Jamal Crawford (LAC): $5,700 vs. SAC (Proj. Pts – 29.23)
The Kings have been the very worst in the league at defending the shooting guard position this season. Crawford’s minutes have been erratic enough that his price remains depressed, but he will occasionally go out and play 38 minutes when he catches fire. I expect him to play big minutes tonight as long as Austin Rivers remains out. Lance Stephenson (MEM): $3,600 vs. LAL (Proj. Pts – 25.33)
The Lakers give up the fourth-most points to opposing benches, plus we all know the Grizzlies are the better team and just beat up the Lakers on Wednesday night. Stephenson is averaging 20 fantasy points in his last three games since he joined the Memphis Grizzlies. He is simply a punt play in our lineup to give us enough salary to bring in the high-scoring players. I expect him to go above his value tonight. DeAndre Jordan (LAC): $7,900 vs. SAC (Proj. Pts – 45.32)
The Clippers have been playing great without Blake Griffin, and they’ve won five of their last six games on the road and have already beaten the Kings twice this season, including a victory in Sacramento. Jordan has been on a tear over his last five games with averages of 15.0 points, 17.2 boards, 1.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.6 blocks on 57.1 percent shooting from the field. I expect him to have a huge game tonight. The last time he faced the Kings he had a fantastic line with 15 points, 18 rebounds, seven blocks and a steal. I see no reason why he shouldn’t repeat that performance.
