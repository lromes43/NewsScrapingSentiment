Going through college with a father in the White House was certainly unusual, but Hager insists her dad’s high-profile job did not have a strong impact on her experience. “When you’re going to college, you’re kind of selfish,” she said. “You’re focused on what you want to study and what you want to become."" Though she said her college experience was mostly typical, Hager felt she had a little bit of a different experience when she woke up on campus on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. “I felt worried about our country and sad for the loss of life. And then, I worried about my parents,” she said. Malia Obama, Barack Obama's oldest daughter, is currently going through the college application process, and Hager said she hopes Malia will find the right fit.

College is really a time in a safe way to make mistakes and explore who you are.” NBC News © 2026 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
