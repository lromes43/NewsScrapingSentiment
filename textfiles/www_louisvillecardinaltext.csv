2016-02-26,"By Roya Fathalizadeh– Want Qdoba delivered to your doorstep? This isn’t a dream, it’s the future of food delivery. Tapingo is an app that has been a recent craze amongst U of L students. It is an easy way to order food around your area where you can just “Tap and Go,” and now it’s bringing your food right to you. “I use Tapingo towards the end of my class every day,” junior Matthew Huetz said. “By the time my class is over I walk over to wherever I ordered my food from and it’s ready, saving me more time in between classes.” Now you can skip the lunchtime chaos altogether, but still get food from your favorite campus restaurants like Cardinal Burger Company, SubHub, Zime and Einstein Bros Bagels. The app helps make crazy-busy, jam packed schedules a little more easy to manage. With businesses continuously partnering with the app, you can get just about any type of food delivered right to you. Once you have placed your order, Tapingo will give you an estimated delivery time. All you have to do is sit back and wait. And get this, there’s no delivery fee. There is a small service fee for using the app for non-campus restaurants. Yet judging by the popularity of the app and its usage, most people look past that. According to Tapingo’s website, 99.7 percent of people who download the app have repeated usage. Although the app has only recently been introduced to U of L’s campus, local and chain businesses across the city are quickly becoming a part of the new “fast” food craze. Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, Panera and Smashburger have all been listed as coming soon.
