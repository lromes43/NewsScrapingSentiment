In April 2015, Ashley Olsen told Women's Wear Daily that they didn't know the show was happening before it was announced to the public. ""I ran into Bob [Saget] the other day and we didn’t even talk about it,” she said. “I’m shocked I haven’t heard from John [Stamos],” said Mary-Kate. According to John Stamos, the twins were asked to be a part of the new series. ""I think there was some confusion. They said first I didn't ask them. And I didn't personally, but I was told they were asked,"" he explained on Howard Stern's radio show. ""So I had a knee-jerk reaction and said, 'Bullshit, I did ask them.' And they got upset, so I did call and talked to Mary-Kate and explained what the show is going to be and told them I'd love for them to be on there and they decided not to, which I respect."" ""Although Ashley and Mary-Kate will not be a part of Fuller House, I know how much Full House has meant to them and they are still very much considered family. It has been exciting to see how they have built their professional careers, and I support their choice to focus on their fashion brands and various business endeavors. I appreciate their support and good wishes towards Fuller House."""
