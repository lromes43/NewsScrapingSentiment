From Eddie Redmayne’s parched face to Susan Sarandon’s cleavage, Jimmy Kimmel helps a new batch of A-listers take an ego-bruising in the latest edition of Mean Tweets. Bond villain Christoph Waltz is handed the first reality check, reading out the line: “I have no idea who Christoph Waltz is. But he is pretty f’n boring so I am not going to bother finding out.” George Clooney might be a two-time winner of People’s Sexiest Man Alive, but according to one user, he’s just another “gross ratty old man” – and if he can bag Amal Clooney then so can you. British heartthrob Eddie Redmayne may have scored his own Burberry campaign opposite Cara Delevingne but in one baffling tweet, he’s told: “Eddie Redmayne looks like someone tried to erase his nose, but couldn’t completely.” But his “permanently dehydrated” face is accurate, as the Danish Girl actor jokingly demanded a glass of water. Susan and Empire star Taraji P. Henson don’t take their insults lying down. After taking on Piers Morgan when he criticised the bra-flashing outfit she wore for the “In Memoriam” section of the SAG Awards, she bit back at another detractor. “Tired of having Susan Sarandon’s  big fat saggy boobs in my face,” one Twitter user wrote, to which she chided: “You wish!” Taraji was told she looked “extremely ghetto in real life lol”, which didn’t go down well. “Well, I can be, b****, meet me outside,” she retorted. Oscar Isaac on the other hand took the high road. “Sounds like a very well adjusted human being,” he replied to a message calling him “a Brooklyn hipster piece of s*** and I’m gonna fight him”. There was an anatomical theme to Sean Penn’s four-fold insult, which focused on various parts of the tweeter’s manhood, while Emily Blunt’s crude tweet took a horrifying turn after admiring her “purdy mouth”. Jaws actor Richard Dreyfuss made a comical slip when he said Jews instead of his famous shark-themed film in the tweet: “Richard Dreyfuss is a very short man… No way he killed Jaws.” Other stars featured include Cate Blanchett, Seth Rogan, Jessica Chastain, Kevin Hart, Zach Galifianakis, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Costner.
