2016-02-26,"Music Bury Choral Society REVIEW: Christmas Festivities concert – Christmas Round the World The programme was delightful. Someone said ""I wish I could have been in the audience and the choir"". Director Juan Ortuño discovered a second choir. Opening with Joy To The World, he abandoned the podium, took his baton to wander among the audience, and said “Bury, there are some very good voices back here”. Christmas Round The World programmed 13 new items, many in national languages including French, Spanish, and Neapolitan plus Yoruba from Nigeria and nearby countries. German, English, Welsh, Polish and Celtic influences could be found in lyrics, translations, compositions or arrangements, and from America White Christmas and the spiritual Rise Up, Shepherd, And Follow. Will there be more countries next year? Quanno Nascette Ninno, the gently lilting Neapolitan bagpipe carol sung in Italian tells of the beauty and peace of the night of the nativity. In contrast, Il Est Né (He is born) is a French carol in jubilation at the birth 4,000 years after it was prophesied. Jonathan Ellis sensitively continued the French flavour with Debussy’s pretty Arabesque No.1 followed by the Ukrainian Carol Of The Bells based on a folk chant associated with the approaching New Year (celebrated in pre-Christian Ukraine in April with the coming of spring). After the interval treat of mulled wine/apple juice and hot mince pies, the truly beautiful A la Nanita Nana was sung in Spanish, before Elin Rees’s contrasting dramatic organ solo Postlude on Adeste Fidelis. The Chilean carol San Pedro Troto Cien Años, in local dialect, depicts the mundane life of San Pedro (St Peter) trotting in the hills for “100 years” which changed from the mundane at the news of the nativity, when the saints sang, the angels took a shot of whisky, and everyone trotted in carnival rejoicing (St P now with holes in his trousers!). As the concert closed, the African drums of Kevin and Christine Kevin Murtagh, George Cartledge and Cherry Trotter added authenticity toBetelehemu - praise for the birth in Bethelehem, the city of wonder. The evening was indeed an overwhelming success. There was not a professional critic present, but among the commendations received were: “This is the best concert I have ever been to.” “Please relay my thanks and good wishes to all, and forward this email directly to Juan Ortuno. As last year (my first attendance), I really enjoyed this year’s evening very much. The ‘international’ carols approach was great and it would be so good to see a similar theme again. The choir was excellent as usual. Juan is just the right guy. It’s great to see his enthusiasm, energy, leadership and personality, and this together with his Spanish accent/language/humour, adds something special to the whole programme. As long as he is at Bury, I’ll keep coming to the concerts! The individual musicians were great too and obviously very talented. Last night’s programme had a very nice/seasonal/happy/fun/slightly ‘cheeky’ musical element to it. Thanks again to everyone.” The choir can accommodate a few more members. It offers hard work, voice production techniques, fun and more. Come and try a few rehearsals without obligation. Music provided, safe parking, near public transport.
