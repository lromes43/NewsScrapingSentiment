The afternoon event, now in its fourth year, began with a champagne reception before Charlie entertained guests with her own story of triumphing against the odds. She told how her childhood dreams of being an artist were crushed by a general attitude of not taking girls seriously. More from the glittering awards ceremony.

Ayoze Perez insists he is ready to answer the call for Newcastle United and play as a lone forward at Stoke City if required. Aleksandar Mitrovic and Papiss Cisse are back in training, but both are unlikely to be fit enough to start the match at The Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night. Instead, 22-year-old forward Perez - who signed a new five-and-a-half year contract earlier this month - could be deployed as a lone frontman, just as he was at Everton. Full comments from Perez.

Jurors tasked with determining whether Adam Johnson is guilty of two sex acts with a child have been urged to convict the man who “unscrupulously manipulated” her. Prosecutors described the sacked Sunderland footballer as an arrogant man who “lied, lied and lied again”, while giving their closing speeches. Kate Blackwell QC said: “He had everything, a glittering career, a beautiful girlfriend, handsome home, healthy new baby daughter, more money than he could possibly spend. What did he do? He cheated on his girlfriend, lied to her and manipulated her in way that shows his exceptional duplicity.” She added: “He lied to police, he lied to his girlfriend, his family. These are lies he has admitted to but the prosecution alleges that he has lied to you the jury. He is lying that it went no further than a kiss.” More on today’s hearing.
