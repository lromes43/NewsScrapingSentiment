Operated by the Darlington-based DeepOcean on a long-term charter from its owners Maersk, Maersk Connector will be used to install subsea array cables for an offshore wind farm project in the country before laying subsea export cables for the world’s largest offshore wind farm in the Irish Sea. Subsequently, it will install a subsea interconnector cable between Belgium and the UK, which will increase the supply of power from the continent to Britain, supporting a reduction in the cost of electricity. DeepOcean has secured offshore renewable and interconnector projects worth in the region of £200m, some of which was unlocked having secured the charter of the vessel. The Maersk Connector is unique in that it is the only vessel with the ability to ground when fully loaded, allowing installation of cables from the beach, in shallow and deep waters. This capability, developed in cooperation between the vessel builder Damen and DeepOcean’s engineering team, represents an important move forward in the drive towards improved offshore efficiencies. While docked in the North East, the vessel will be fitted with an advanced split capacity carousel produced by Parkburn Precision Handling Systems. Fabricated at A&amp;P, the structure - which has an outer diameter of 27.3m and is 7.5m tall - enables the vessel to carry 7,000 tonnes of cable. The installation of the carousel and associated equipment, which will be managed by DeepOcean, will be carried out at the A&amp;P yard over two months before the vessel heads to Belgium in the summer. It will be crewed by 90 people, including 70 of DeepOcean’s specialist offshore personnel. Another North East firm, IHC, meanwhile, will be delivering an advanced cable plough for the vessel, which will be fitted later in the year at the Port of Blyth.

DeepOcean commercial director Pierre Boyde said: “We are extremely proud of the Maersk Connector, which demonstrates the benefits of close collaboration and innovative design and engineering. “Its ability to lay cable from the shore to deep waters is a significant efficiency gain for offshore projects, which is a key consideration for the energy industry. “It also proves the value of the UK supply chain and the quality of the businesses serving the international offshore sector. “DeepOcean is always keen to utilise local suppliers who share our valves and can bring new ideas and efficiencies to our projects. “The investment in the Maersk Connector represents DeepOcean’s increasing presence in the offshore renewables and interconnector markets. “Our continued growth in these sectors supports a programme of research and development to improve offshore operations, which includes establishing productive, long-term relationships with the supply chain.” At  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.
