2016-02-26,"“This review has been brought by the police quite properly following the very tragic deaths of Mr Milburn and Mr Glaister who had attended the club on Boxing Night. “We have heard extensive information about the measures the club takes to determine drug taking and drug use at the premises...it’s clear from the information provided by Merseyside Police they have always been satisfied by the cooperation with the club. It’s also clear the club has acted very responsibly reviewing their procedures following the events of boxing night.” Cllr Banks says there is no need to suspend or revoke the club’s licence, simply to formalise as conditions the steps they already take to tackle drugs. Cllr Peter Brennan, also on the panel, adds: “the conditions that cream have submitted are admirable and I just wish that other clubs in the city did half as much as what you do.”  Conditions added to Cream’s licence include: And that is that, thank you following this today. A full report will be on the echo website shortly. We are back in, and Cllr Christine Banks is giving the panel’s judgement. Right, following that, everyone has been asked to leave the chamber while the three person panel considers the outcome of this hearing. Essentially, they are considering whether a host of conditions requested by police are officially written into the premises licence. Mr Taylor: “There are real challenges in detecting people, it’s not an easy, straight forward job, but the club is doing its very best and being proactive and working with the police.” He adds that the club accepts the police desire to have the anti drugs policies written into its licence and, when summing up, stresses this review has not come as a result of any licence breach or neglect on the club’s behalf. He also says there are seven checks clubbers need to go through before they can even enter the premises, all of which provide opportunities to catch those with drugs. In total 51 staff are involved in anti drugs policies on a typical club night. Simon Taylor is now going through Cream’s representation. Detailing the large extent to which the club combats drugs at the premises, he lists the use of spotters, trained staff, drug detection dogs, searches, undercover staff and manned Cctv among the tactics employed by Cream. While Sgt Hearty offers praise to Cream for their anti drugs policies, he says none of these are written into the club’s licence and is calling for measures to be officially added in writing. He adds: “I’ve always found them to be cooperative and responsive to any concerns we have raised.” He further praises organisers, saying on every occasion club staff called police and supported the subsequent investigations. He said: “We are not ignorant to the fact there are drugs in the night time economy and what we look for is licensed premises to be proactive… “In relation to this club, Nation, there is a huge amount of drug use linked to the premises. But at the same time the club has been and is proactive with these issues. In all of these incidents I have referred to the staff have called the police.” In every one of those incidents, the men were caught by staff at Cream - from spotters to doormen. Sgt Hearty praises the club on several levels - for often spotting problems before people entered the club and continuing to spot suspected drug dealers inside the premises. Sgt Hearty said “there were clear issues about drugs linked to the premises”. He lists a host of arrests made on suspicion of drug related incidents last year. He goes through 10 incidents, where males were found with a variety of drugs on them - from cocaine to ecstasy - throughout 2015. One of those saw a man jailed earlier this week. Others saw men caught with bags of white powder and tablets, one of whom had drugs hidden in a Kinder egg. Many are going through the legal process now. We are back in now and Sgt Hearty is going through the police case. After the tragic incidents on Boxing Night he reviewed events over the previous 12 months. Myself and almost everyone bar the legal experts have now been excluded. One significant aspect of this hearing is that we are likely to be able to hear Cream comprehensively respond to questions about arrangements on the night. The Echo has offered them that opportunity before this meeting, but it may have been that bosses wanted to reserve comment for an official setting. Before the exclusions of the press and public, Sgt Hearty gives an opening paragraph, in which he explains this review was called for as a result of the incidents on Boxing Night. Following a short deliberation in private, the panel has decided to hear the fine details surrounding the on going police investigation in private. I have, however, received assurances that most of the hearing - including all of Cream’s evidence - will be in public. Sgt Hearty has asked for the press and public to be excluded for a short part of the hearing while he discusses the investigation into the two deaths. While this is typical, I have challenged this, arguing there is a significant public interest in knowing as much as possible about what happened. Among other things it could influence the actions of both club owners and the tens of thousands of clubbers going out in Liverpool this weekend - there may be warnings or advice that could help everyone stay safer. It appears we also have an official who is part of the investigation team handling things in the Isle of Man, where Andrew Glaister, one of those who died after the club night, was from. We also Simon Taylor, who is Cream’s legal advocate. He is here with designated premises supervisor Steve Fitzsimmons and event’s operations manager, communications manager and managing director. Right, we have been called in to the council chamber, where everyone has been asked to introduce themselves. The meeting is chaired by Cllr Christine Banks, who will hear evidence from Merseyside Police, whose representatives include sergeant Michael Hearty. Good morning everyone, I’m here at Liverpool town hall where bosses behind the iconic club night Cream are set to face questions over their anti drugs policies. Plenty of people here for the hearing, representing Cream, the police and council. On arrival there was even a group of Augsburg fans taking the tour of the town hall chambers. This is set to be a slightly unusual licensing review in that Nation, the Liverpool city centre venue that is the traditional home of Cream, has since closed and is set to be demolished. The club will make way for part of a £40m development plan for Wolstenholme Square, though those plans do include a new superclub. To an extent, this review may have an impact on Cream’s role in that. Cream also has events elsewhere, so perhaps police believe the review is necessary to see if any lessons can be learned for the running of those events too. Just to stress once more, the causes of the two deaths following Cream’s finale at Nation have not yet been confirmed. Detectives have previously said drugs is one line of enquiry though. Anti-drugs tactics used at Cream’s farewell party to historic home Nation will come under scrutiny today following two deaths after the Boxing Night event. John Milburn and Andrew Glaister died after falling ill at the club night’s last ever showing at the Liverpool city centre venue. While the cause of both deaths has not yet been confirmed, police have since called for Cream’s premises licence to be reviewed over concerns about the prevention of drugs misuse on the night. Detectives have previously stated that one line of enquiry into the double tragedy is that the deaths were drug related. Cream will be questioned by council and police licensing chiefs at today’s Liverpool town hall hearing. Ahead of the hearing organisers have been backed by an ex-employee, clubber and nearby residents - who all say Cream has made significant efforts to combat drugs in Liverpool’s clubland."
