2016-02-26,"Westfield Century City’s $800 million redevelopment is in phase two of its “modernization and beautification” project, but the mall’s current state is in dismal conditions. Amid construction cranes and crews and debris and wreckage, visitors are still shopping and dining at the 60 storefronts currently open at the mall. Some stores have relocated from their former locations; Rolex, Tesla, and Reginals are now in the Kids’ Wing near Zara, and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is near Yogurtand and BreadBar. In case guests get disoriented around the soot and rubble, Westfield-branded Guest Ambassadors are stationed around the mall to answer questions. Opening in phases beginning in late 2016, the new Westfield Century City will encompass 1.2 million square feet of retail space, double the available parking to more than 4,700 spaces, and create new world-class anchors: a new three-level Nordstrom, completely remodeled three-level Bloomingdale’s, new two-level Macy’s, and the West Coast’s first Eataly. Eataly has become a mythical creature in and of itself in the years leading up to its premier arrival to Los Angeles. The world’s largest Italian market place comprises a variety of restaurants, food and beverage counters, bakery, retail items, and a cooking school, and is slated to open alongside renovations in late 2016. The multi-million dollar redesign of Westfield Century City has been over a decade in the making, Westfield Co-CEO Peter Lowy revealed in August. “When this project is complete, we will have redefined the very nature of shopping on the Westside of L.A.,” Lowy said. “The mall will be a showcase for 230 shops featuring 55 restaurants and cafes with fresh, local, and seasonal dining choices. I’m excited to announce that the first phase of the project will be open in time for the holidays in 2016.” First opened in 1964, the Century City mall has gone through redevelopments in 1980 and again in 1991. After acquiring the property in 2002, Westfield undertook its first redevelopment in 2005, to include the introduction of AMC Theatres and new al fresco dining terrace, popular with professionals working in the adjacent Century City business district and shoppers alike.
