A Ballarat taxi driver has recalled the night he was assaulted on the job, describing the experience as making him feel “insipid”. Login or signup to continue reading On September 6 last year, James Cousens was one of two taxi drivers assaulted by a man who has since been placed on an 18-month community corrections order and banned from entering any licensed venues for the next six months. In a hearing in the Ballarat Magistrates Court on Tuesday, the man pleaded guilty to 13 charges including two counts of recklessly causing injury. The court heard that Mr Cousens had seen the assailant in the middle of the road and had slowed down to avoid hitting him, but said there was “some sort of connection” with the man. Unsure if he had hit the man or if the man struck the taxi, Mr Cousens pulled over to investigate when the assailant became agitated. As Mr Cousens attempted to get back in the car, the man began punching him to the head and face. Mr Cousens said the attack had seen him miss several days of work, but had more significant psychological ramifications. “The effect for me was that it cost me about $3000. In repairs and lost earnings,” he said. “It was embarrassing on Father’s Day when you’re sitting at the table. Your parents are there, your wife and children are sitting there and they’re looking at you like ‘what have you been doing? You look like you’ve been out on a drunken bender.” “You felt a bit insipid, really. Like you’re a bit of a weakling. (You think) ‘why didn’t you do anything about it?’” “Helpless is a better way of putting it. Like you’re not man enough to do anything about it. “I didn’t retaliate. There’s no point in doing that. All you’re trying to do is get out of the situation as quickly as you can.” However, Mr Cousens still considers himself lucky to have escaped with minor injuries and said there is a bigger problem in regards to public perception of taxi drivers. While most, he says, give drivers their due respect, some still view them as “at the bottom of the food chain”. In his eight years in the caper, Mr Cousens said this is just the second physical incident he has been exposed to, but said he dreads Saturday night shifts. “The incident… I see it like tattslotto,” he said. “You buy enough tickets eventually you’re going to win. You drive taxis enough, eventually this is going to happen to you.” “I think we are perceived publicly as though we’re at the bottom end of the food chain.” “It’s a mentality. You have to change the mindset. How you’re going to do that, I don’t have the answer to that.” Daily Today's top stories curated by our news team.
