In a Skype call, a young woman recounts how she was abused by her parents, placed in foster care and sexually abused there. ""I was in twenty five foster homes, three group homes and four locked facilities and I was sexually abused in my foster home..so I was move and from that time on I kept moving and moving."" Rachel Irby -who runs Unchained Movement --- a rescue home for sex slaves, says ""the girl didn't really have good choices in front of her...she could stay in foster care where she was being abused or she could run away and experience the street life."" It's a situation Irby understands. Her mother tried to sell her for sex as a child.  She says her own mom was trafficked at the age of 14. Ultimately, the young woman on the Skype call ran to a life that sounded better on Facebook. ""I'm on Facebook and there's this guy and I'm talking to him...and he was like I will fly you out to New York and I''m like okay, cool"" the girl says. The child sex slavery trade, also called human trafficking or modern day slavery grew 846% in the past five years according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They say it is directly related to the use of the internet. Facebook, Instagram, Backpage and Twitter are all in play. A couple of weeks after the screening call on Skype, the young woman on the other end takes that first step into freedom.  She arrives in Nashville at the undisclosed safe house and begins going through bins of donated clothes and toiletries.  She'll spend the next year getting her GED, intensive counseling, a job, health care .  All important steps on a long road to recovery.    It's a great start full of hope for a young woman who's never really had any. 2026 Sinclair, Inc."
