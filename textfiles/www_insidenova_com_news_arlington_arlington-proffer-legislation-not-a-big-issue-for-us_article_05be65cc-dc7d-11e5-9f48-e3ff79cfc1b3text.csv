2016-02-26,"   Arlington County Board member Jay Fisette. Many words have been uttered and ink has been spilled during the 2016 General Assembly session on the issue of “proffers” – agreements between developers and localities that lay out what benefits the developer will offer in exchange for specific zoning approvals. But Arlington officials have been largely silent on the matter. And there’s a reason. Legislation impacting proffers that has been debated in Richmond “doesn’t affect us so much, because we don’t use proffers so much,” said County Board Vice Chairman Jay Fisette, the board’s liaison for state-legislative affairs. Most development in Arlington is either “by-right,” with developers using the zoning already on a parcel, or through the site-plan process, where the county and property owners negotiate through a defined protocol. Proffers generally are more prevalent in communities, such as Loudoun and Prince William counties, where development is planned on large swaths of land. Fisette said the county government was keeping an eye on proposed legislation as it moves through the General Assembly, and that the Virginia Association of Counties and Virginia Municipal League are watching the situation on behalf of members, including Arlington. Among the measures on the matter percolating in Richmond is a bill by Del. Todd Gilbert (R-Woodstock), which would prohibit localities from requesting “unreasonable” proffer conditions of developers or from rejecting rezoning plans if developers balk at unreasonable requests. Gilbert’s measure passed the House of Delegates 68-27, with three members of the Arlington delegation (Patrick Hope, Mark Levine and Rip Sullivan) supporting it and Alfonso Lopez voting against it. It has been sent to the state Senate.  Real-time social media posts from local businesses and organizations across Northern Virginia, powered by Friends2Follow.
