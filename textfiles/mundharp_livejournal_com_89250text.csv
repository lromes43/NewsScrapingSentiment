Kenya February 26 2016, 10:15 The kids went off to school as usual. Today is a day that the Lord has made, and it is good! I had my shower and went to my bank, Barclays, to check my balance at their ATM. The balance of my pension has still not come through, so I couldn't draw any cash. My overdraft is at its limit! Therefore I can't buy more cell phone air time to re-load my internet. Can't be helped, but I so rely on the “web”! So I will continue to write my blog, but I can't post it until I get back on line... So after returning to the house I spent a quiet day alone. I am trying to write, but I am finding it hard to get the inspiration to do so just now... Lencer has gone to register to vote, to be included in the electoral roll. Next year is the General Election in Kenya. I believe that every citizen across the world should take the trouble to register, and to vote in every election. People who don't bother to vote should not complain when they get bad politicians in power! LATER It seems that Lencer spent most of her day standing in line at the electoral registration office, but the office closed before she got to register. She said she will return tomorrow. While she was out her sister Belinda called around to the house to cook supper for everyone, it was very kind of her. The evening was very quiet, and everyone got home safely. I have no internet at the moment and will post this blog when I get web access. Photo:Kenya washing line.  v.910"
