Karkashian said track works at the line entrance are complete and an electric engine is being tested between the Kwasa Sentral and Surian stations. The underground stations are currently being fitted with electrical and mechanical equipment, he told reporters after presenting cash prizes of RM7,000 to six winners of the MRT Station Bench Seating Design contest at the KVMRT training centre in Kuala Lumpur.
“There is still a lot of work (to be completed),” said Karkashian, adding that first phase work is on schedule. He said a complete systems test might take place in September.

Second last sentence. Thanks for pointing out the error, a correction has been made. Time flies. Please ensure this project able reduce or solve traffic jam and make people life become more easy. otherwise, wasted money for this project and caused people suffer during construction for nothing It depends if Malaysians want to use or not. If pipu still wanna high keras die die want to use car jam here jam there, then onli the Banglas r smart enuff to use public transportation. It will not solve the jam. I live in kinrara. Now there is a new lrt extension service. But the jam got worse. Very few people are using it. Last time some people objected to build new highways and said better to build public transportation to solve traffic jam issues. Thats because it is not well integrated with other station yet. extension just increase capture area further behind Puchong. But not much impact unless other gap in the city has been covered, which what MRT 1, 2 and 3 should provide. mr mohan sir, i know its a typo, but i just cant stop laughing at the last paragraph… kardashian! lol… too much kardashian on the internet ey? Once the MRT kajang completed, house prices there will be ‘unbearable’ ….. If there is one thing that the government is doing right, this will be it albeit the heavy constructions and temporary jams. Kudos to the government for improving our daily lives. If there is one thing that the government is doing right, this will be it albeit the heavy constructions and temporary jams.
