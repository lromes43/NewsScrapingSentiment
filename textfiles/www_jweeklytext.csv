2016-02-26,"J. The Jewish News of Northern California J. The Jewish News of Northern California Sign up for Weekday J and get the latest on what's happening in the Jewish Bay Area.  Becky Grintsaig, 17, of Danville is among 30 finalists from across the United States and Israel who will compete in “She’s Got Talent,” a contest sponsored by New York NCSY (a division of the Orthodox Union’s international youth movement) to showcase gifted and artistic female amateur performers. Grintsaig, a junior at the Jewish Community High School of the Bay in San Francisco, plans to sing “Astonishing” from the Broadway play “Little Women” when she competes in the finals in Brooklyn on Sunday, Feb. 28. She was selected from among 170 hopefuls, ages 6 to 20-plus, who submitted 60-second videos showing off their talent. The experience, said Carol Rhine of New York NCSY, “epitomizes the opportunity for Jewish girls and women to empower themselves and others by expressing their passion through the arts.” P.S. Grintsaig is a multitalented young woman! She just won a Gold Key in the Regional Scholastic Art & Writing Awards for her submission of flash fiction (1,000 or fewer words) called “Falling Bodies.”

 

Fammies go to…A number of volunteers who have taken leadership roles in Jewish Family and Children’s Services programs will be honored at “Love Life,” JFCS’ 2016 Fammy Awards Gala on Saturday, Feb. 27 at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. Frank Stein and his life and business partner Paul May (of blessed memory) are being recognized for their support of JFCS’ Parents Place, and Nona Miloslavsky for her contributions to the JFCS Shupin House. Stephanie Lauter, Laura Robbin, Lyla Nathan, Alison Ross, Janet Quint and Rebecca Susser will be honored for founding and developing the JFCS food pantry. Kerri and Mark Lehmann are gala chairs.

 


Short shortsYou’re invited to “reserve a seat on the savannah” to help honor Bruce Raful at the cleverly named Kol Shofari, Congregation Kol Shofar’s annual gala and fundraiser on March 4. Raful, of San Anselmo, is being recognized for “decades of dedication and spirited service” to the Tiburon congregation … Proud Kehilla Community Synagogue dad Richard Meyers reports that his eighth-grade son Caleb Meyers is in the cast of Berkeley Playhouse’s production of “Bridges: A New Musical.” … Alexander Ben-Israel of Palo Alto is the new executive director of Moldaw Residences. He joins the Palo Alto senior living community with 25 years of experience in the industry … Rosalyn “Ros” Gold-Onwude, sideline reporter for the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, was among the celebrities speaking at Macy’s Union Square on Feb. 17 in celebration of Black History Month.

This week, J. bids shalom to Managing Editor Andy Altman-Ohr, who has led our newsroom these past few years and covered the local Jewish food and bagel scene with exceedingly good taste. He’s off to Mexico with his lovely wife, Stacey, but will continue to freelance for J. from south of the border. Meanwhile, we welcome Donny Inbar as J.’s news editor. Donny is well known in the local community for his many years at the S.F.-based Jewish Community Federation’s Israel Center, as associate and then acting director, as well as for his previous stint as cultural attaché at the Israeli Consulate. An artist, theater maven and former Ha’aretz editor, Donny brings a wealth of knowledge and an Israeli sensibility to the job. He can be reached at [email protected].
