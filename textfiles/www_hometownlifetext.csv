2016-02-26,"Amy Trombley’s teaching has touched a generation of students in the Plymouth-Canton area. Longtime fellow teacher Cynthia Bernstein, the leader at New School High, where Trombley teaches language arts, recalls a mother who stopped in recently to enroll her son. “The mother was a former student of Amy’s who could not hold back tears when speaking of Amy and the way she encouraged her when no one else had,” Bernstein recalled in nominating Trombley for an American Legion award. “She wanted the same for her son.” Trombley, who spent nearly 20 years with the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, brings that same connection to her new job at New School, where it’s an important part of the culture, Bernstein said. “Most people do an awful lot better when they feel they have some kind of bond,” said Bernstein, who launched New School last summer with other local educators. “Amy sets the tone of, really, just a great deal of caring for the kids.” Trombley has high expectations for her students, Bernstein said, and is a good example for younger teachers. “We work together super well as a team, all the teachers here,” Trombley said. Army service She was recently named one of five American Legion teachers of the year in Michigan for 2016. The award is based on competence, community involvement, and the school’s involvement in programs that demonstrate patriotism or community service. She must’ve gotten high marks in the patriotism category: Trombley spent 30 years in the Army Reserve, where she was an officer. She is now in the retired reserves. “I actually loved doing both jobs,” Trombley said during her lunch break Wednesday “I’m a high-energy person, so that actually worked out well for me.” Trombley teaches English to New School’s freshmen and sophomores, plus reading and creative and expository writing. She also leads the yearbook class, which is documenting New School’s inaugural year, and a class that’s writing a student handbook. Her high energy was apparent in her 1 p.m. class Wednesday as Trombley introduced a small group of students to William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. She told them it was her task to convince them that Shakespeare, handed down through the centuries, was worth holding onto. “I love teaching Shakespeare,” she told students. “If you can read Shakespeare and decipher it, you should be able to transfer that (skill) to other writings.” Trombley and Bernstein, a retired Salem High School English teacher, have been acquainted for years, and Trombley was on board early as New School was being organized, Bernstein said. “I really didn’t know what we would need or how it would go,” she said. “Amy, right from the beginning, just really wanted to do this.” Teaching the teacher Trombley likes the charter school’s hands-on approach. She cited the computer cataloging and checkout system, for the small library in her classroom, as an example: A group of students researched different systems, recommended one and implemented it, she said. “In the real world, that’s what you do,” she said. Trombley said her enthusiasm is fueled by seeing that ideas are clicking with students. “I absolutely love those moments,” she said. As she’s teaching students, she added, they’re often teaching her as well. “They see things a little bit differently, so they’re able to contribute to the conversation from a different generation or a different perspective,” she said. Trombley’s American Legion award comes with $500 for an education project, and Trombley plans to use the money to supplement the yearbook budget. “We want to make sure that every kid can have a book,” said Bernstein. New School High, in the education wing of the Risen Christ Church, is chartered by Central Michigan University and is open to students from the Plymouth-Canton area and surrounding communities. The school has no religious affiliation and is tuition-free. mjachman@hometownlife.com | 734-678-8432 Twitter: @mattjachman Download our free apps foriPhone , iPad or Android!"
