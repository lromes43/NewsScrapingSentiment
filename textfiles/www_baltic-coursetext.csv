2016-02-26,"The results acquired will provide
opportunity to estimate number of divorces in upcoming years and to study
processes of family migration (internal and international). Base period used
for the research is year 2001, as on it the oldest statistics on marriages is
available in administrative registers, moreover it is possible to update the
information with the latest data.
 
Till 1991, the number of marriages
and divorced in Latvia was rather high. During the period from 1991 to 1996,
when Latvia regained its independence, a change in population habits may
be observed – number of registered marriages is reducing rapidly, while number
of divorces is decreasing comparatively slower (relative indicators are falling
as well). Starting from 1996, the number of marriages and divorces registered
in Latvia annually is smaller, but stable. Due to the improvement of economic
situation in the country, notable rise in the marriage number was recorded in
2007 and 2008. Whereas in 2011, along with the introduction of the legislation
easing divorce process and possibility to divorce marriage at notary, the
number of divorces increased.Number of marriages and divorces in 1970 – 2014
In 2001, 9 258 marriages were
registered in Latvia; for 72% it was first marriage and for 24% – second
marriage. The study does not include 46 foreign couples, the information about
marital status of which is not available in administrative registers.
 
On 1 January 2016, out of 9 212
couples 60.4% were still married, 32.6% were divorced, while 7% marriages ended
as one of the spouses had passed away.
25.8% of couples married in 2001
currently have no children, 34.6% have one common child, 30.1% – two children,
8.0% – three children, and 1.5% – 4 or more children. The statistics do not
include children of one of the spouses.
 
The main duration of marriage till
divorce is 4–7 years (every year 2.7–3.7% of couples divorced). Increase in the
number of marriages lasting for 10–11 years meets the time period, when also
notaries were allowed to divorce marriage.Duration of marriage for couples married in 2001
10.2% of all couples, who married in
2001, had common children at the moment, when the marriage was concluded. 23.4%
of couples had their first child in the first marriage year (2001), while 21.0%
had first child in the second marriage year (2002). Second child in most
families was born in 3–7 years after the marriage was concluded, whereas third
child most often was born in 8–12 years.
 
At the beginning of 2016, out of the
total number of couples married in 2001 and still living together 93.8% lived
in Latvia, 73.5% – still lived in the same region as in 2001, and 63.7% – in
the same county or city under state jurisdiction. In line with the
international practice, place of residence of a couple, if it is not the same
for both spouses, is determined basing on the place of residence of the male.
The research shows that couples without children mainly live in Riga or cities
under state jurisdiction, whereas couples with two or more children – in small
towns or rural municipalities.
 
Within the framework of the research
also influence of the average spouse age, age difference and educational
attainment thereof on the possible divorce was studied.
 
In 2001, the average age of the
persons marrying was between 17 and 88 years for males and between 16 and 91
years for females. The average age of male at the moment, when the marriages
was registered, was 31 year and age of female – 28.5 years. The research allows
concluding that, the higher average age of couple at marriage the lower
possibility of divorcing. On average males are 2.5 years older than females.
However, research results indicate that age difference does not influence
divorce risk.
 
Analysis of the educational
attainment of couples married in 2001 is based on the Population and Housing
Census 2011 data (10 years after the marriage registration). In 40.0% of the
total number of corresponding couples females have acquired higher level of
education than males, in 38.5% both spouses have equal educational attainment,
while in 21.4% – education of husband is higher.
 
The research allows concluding that
couples, in which both spouses have equal educational attainment are still
married (65% of all couples married in 2001).
 
To estimate the possibility of
divorcing, the male and female educational attainment difference was
calculated. The results acquired are graphed, showing higher educational
attainment of male on the right and higher educational attainment of female on
the left. Share of couples still married by difference in educational attainment (%)
Male with a lower level of education
is greater ""threat"" to marriage (possibility to stay together equals
43%) than female with lower education (possibility to stay together – 48.6%).
However, in both cases, as difference in educational attainment increases, the
possibility of divorcing rises.
 
Among couples, which have acquired
higher level of education, the possibility to be still married is higher.
Persons with basic or lower education are more likely to divorce, regardless
the educational attainment of the other spouse.Possibility that couple is still married by level of education acquired by spouses (%)
Research on persons married in 2001
covers only a period of 15 years. Assessment of future marital status of the
married couples is based on the analysis of the share of divorces among the
marriages concluded in the corresponding year. For example, if couple married
in 1984, but in 2014 it divorced, duration of the marriage thereof is 30 years.
As a result estimates are made for the percentage share of couples married in
1984, which divorced in 2014. The curve acquired is compared to the divorce
line of couples married in 2001.Share of divorces in the marriages concluded in the corresponding year (%)
Both curves in the common part
indicate similar trend, except the break caused by the economic crisis and
option to divorce at notary. Experts assume that divorce estimate for the
couples married in 2001 will be somewhat similar to the curve depicting
divorces registered in 2014, and they forecast that in future 14.4% more of the
couples married in 2001 will divorce.
 
When analysing marriages registered
in 2001, CSB experts estimate that, adding 32.6% of couples, who have already
divorced till 1 January 2016, 47% out of the total number of couples married in
2001 will divorce during their lifetime. While 53% will stay legally married
till the end of their life. The results acquired will provide
opportunity to estimate number of divorces in upcoming years and to study
processes of family migration (internal and international). Base period used
