The administration barely sounds convinced itself. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the outline of the agreement earlier this week, laboring to sound optimistic. Only by agreeing to and implementing this cease-fire will a path open up toward negotiating a long-term peace agreement, he said. Few are suggesting the agreement will slow the refugee crisis or bring anything resembling peace to Syria. And we know it won’t dislodge Syrian President Bashar Assad, now emboldened by support from Vladimir Putin and Russia’s relentless bombing campaign. Putin helped engineer this suspension of hostilities, but the agreement does not apply to the terrorist groups Islamic State or to the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. Since Syria and its Russian patron have dubbed all rebels terrorists, the notion that beginning at midnight tonight the skies over Syria will be quiet seems fanciful. The best this agreement might do, if it holds, is to provide the necessary security conditions to deliver more humanitarian aid to the sick and to the starving, and to buy more time for the parties to talk some more. That is, if the agreement even takes; this is the second attempt this month to orchestrate a temporary end to hostilities. If it breaks down, the voices within the White House who favor more robust military support for the Syrian opposition will grow louder. Is anyone listening? Copyright 2026 Boston Herald.
