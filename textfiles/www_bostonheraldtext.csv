He didn’t want his name in print, and though, like me, he hoped for a win, he admitted he wasn’t expecting it. “I understand Hillary’s hold here, but on the other hand Bernie’s raised $40 million last month. So, no matter what happens, I know he’ll be in it for the long haul,” he said. “And I think we need his 74-year-old energy and more important, his hope.” On the other end of the spectrum, I took the pulse of a friend who is young enough to pass for a millennial, but old enough to be in the working world for several years. “Who did you vote for?” I asked. “(Marco) Rubio,” he replied, “because Hillary (Clinton) could be in cuffs and still beat (Donald) Trump. Besides, the thing about millenials who love Bernie is most of them haven’t been out there in the working world long enough to understand how things really work. “Everyone agrees with Bernie’s argument that college tuitions are out of control, that’s nothing new,” he said. “I think it’s a little too easy to identify a problem like that when you really don’t have a realistic solution for how to change it.” In a way, the heart of yesterday’s primary here was about the drastically different visions of two “outsiders.” There is Donald Trump, whose arrogant indignation is squarely focused on bragging, denigrating and bullying. And there’s Bernie, whose irascible spirit is about invigorating the imaginations of voters who have come to believe that idealism is not just an empty word. Bernie Sanders has already forced Hillary Clinton to become a tougher candidate, one who should be able to survive a cage match against The Donald. And she won’t be wearing handcuffs, either.
