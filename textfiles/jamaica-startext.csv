It was reported that many persons across the island, who turned out to cast their votes, had to return home without doing so because lines were too long and election equipment had been malfunctioning. Candidates from both the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People’s National Party (PNP) have also been complaining of the slow voting process and that the electoral machines were malfunctioning. According to reports from the EOJ, as at 1:00p.m. over 500,000 persons had voted, which accounts for 31.54 per cent of the voting population. There are 1,824,412 electors on the voters’ list. Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. and will close at 5:00 p.m. EOJ said special accommodation will be made for voters who were in line before 5:00p.m. This will allow them to cast their vote.
