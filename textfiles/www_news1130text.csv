VICTORIA (NEWS 1130) – An RCMP officer has been charged with assault in connection with the arrest of a young man nearly two years ago in northwest British Columbia. The youth was allegedly injured during an arrest in Terrace on May 28, 2014. No details have been released about the allegations or the injuries the young man sustained. Terrace Mounties received a video related to the incident in October 2014 and after viewing it, reported the incident to the Independent Investigations Office, which oversees any police-involved deaths or serious injuries. The police watchdog investigated, determined the officer may have committed an offence and forwarded the file to the Criminal Justice Branch. Const. Bruce Lofroth has been charged with a single count of assault and is scheduled to appear in a court on March 7.
