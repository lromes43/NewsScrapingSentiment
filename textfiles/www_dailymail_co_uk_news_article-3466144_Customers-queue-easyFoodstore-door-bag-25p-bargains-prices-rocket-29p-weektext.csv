It said: 'From the 1st March 2016 we will be reducing our range of products from approximately 70 down to 40 of the best selling items. 'Finally the new special promotional price for the months of March and April 2016 will be 29p per item in store, whilst stocks last. Happy shopping.'   Last week the shop in Park Royal had to limit the number of same items people bought to 10 cans after 'overwhelming demand' and fears shopkeepers were buying food to resell at higher prices. The shop sells items like tins of baked beans and tuna as well as store cupboard goods like pasta and rice. A weekly shop for a family of four costs just £15.75 inside, and a three course dinner, complete with a pasta as a main course and a houmous starter comes in at just £2.75.

The business is the latest venture by the founder of low-cost airline easyJet, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Ahead of the shop's launch, he said: 'This is another way the easy brand can serve the less well-off. 'Given my experience in distributing food for free in Greece and Cyprus, this is a more commercial attempt to sell basic food for 25p per item to those less well-off in the Park Royal area.' The easyFoodstore concept has been in the pipeline since 2013, when Sir Stelios, a Cyprus-born British entrepreneur who set up the airline in 1995, decided to expand his sprawling empire of 'easy' branded companies into the supermarket sector.
