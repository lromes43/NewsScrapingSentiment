2016-02-26,"Entertainment THE ACCLAIMED Chichester Theatre revival of musical Guys And Dolls is coming to Leeds Grand. Stars of film, TV and the West End play the four leading roles in the show about a romance between a charismatic gambler and a Salvation Army girl. The pair, Sky Masterson and Sarah Brown, are played by Richard Fleeshman, from Coronation Street, Ghost The Musical and Call The Midwife , and Anna O’Byrne from Phantom Of The Opera sequel Love Never Dies. The classic show’s other romantic duo, Nathan Detroit and Adelaide, are played by Maxwell Caulfield, who hit the big time in Grease 2, and went on to star in The Colbys and Emmerdale, and West End star Louise Dearman who has appeared in Wicked and Evita. Guys And Dolls is described as a joyous and vibrant celebration of Prohibition-era New York, which on its Broadway premiere in 1950 captured the optimism and energy of post-World War Two America. Nathan Detroit is desperate – he needs money for an illegal dice game, and he needs it fast. He has been engaged to nightclub singer Miss Adelaide for 14 years and her patience running out. Enter notorious gambler Sky Masterson, a guy who can never turn down a bet, and straight-laced missionary Sarah Brown, a doll with a heart of ice. Nathan’s wager is that Sky has to romance Sarah by taking her to Havana for dinner and in return he’ll provide a dozen ‘sinners’ for Sarah’s mission. Surely this is one bet Nathan absolutely can't lose? The multi award-winning musical is based on the colourful stories by American journalist Damon Runyon, who was renowned for his vivid fictional depictions of the gamblers, hustlers and nightclub singers of New York. The show features some of Broadway’s greatest musical numbers including My Time Of Day, Luck Be A Lady and the show-stopping Sit Down You're Rockin' The Boat. Guys And Dolls is at The Grand Theatre, Leeds, from May 24 to 28. Visit leedsgrandtheatre.com or call 0844 8482700 to book tickets.
