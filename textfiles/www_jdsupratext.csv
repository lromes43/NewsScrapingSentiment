2016-02-26," How many stars would you give Yelp as an employer? Read on! Yelp denies that she was fired because of her letter, but they haven’t stated a reason, either. First, I don’t think I would have fired Ms. Ben-Ora for that letter. Complaining publicly about her employer was a dumb thing for her to do, but she’s young and inexperienced. She wasn’t nasty or abusive, either — just thought she should be earning enough to support herself in the manner to which she hoped to become accustomed. Don’t we all? (I assume the firing would not violate the National Labor Relations Act because it didn’t appear that Ms. Ben-Ora was acting on behalf of a group or preparing for group action. But with our current NLRB, you never know.) At the same time, I don’t think Yelp was morally obligated to pay its customer support employees a “living wage.” Ms. Ben-Ora was an English literature major* just out of school working in an entry-level job. The expectation is that kids out of school will take low-wage jobs like this, get experience working for a great company, develop a work ethic, acquire some marketable skills, and move up. I have some sympathy for “living wage” arguments — especially for disadvantaged or older employees who may be in their low-wage jobs for life — but not when applied to young college grads who are simply paying their dues. *Like Ms. Ben-Ora, I had an A.B. in English lit, and had a series of low-paying jobs before I went to law school. Of course, in those days, law school was a better investment than it is now. Another thing that confused me — I thought Ms. Ben-Ora moved to San Francisco to be near her dad, who lived out there. If so, then why didn’t she move in with her dad, with free room and board, until she’d had a chance to save some money or get a few promotions at Yelp? In Yelp’s further defense, I liked the response of the CEO, Jeremy Stoppelman, who not only did not attack Ms. Ben-Ora, but he actually admitted that the cost of living in San Francisco was way too high for low-wage workers. The company plans to move its customer support office to more-affordable Arizona. I’ll give Yelp three stars as an employer based on its treatment of Ms. Ben-Ora. This rating is subject to change if we ever find out the true reason for her termination. Here are a few considerations for college grads with liberal arts degrees who are looking for jobs: All that being said, some tech companies are paying subsidies to lower-wage employees who have to live in the high-rent district because of their jobs. Yelp, if you start a program like this, it might get you 3.5 stars! P.S. Wouldn’t you know it! As soon as I was getting ready to hit “Publish” on this post, I saw that my friend Jason Shinn of the Michigan Employment Law Advisor had already posted on this subject. (Jason, I promise that I didn’t realize that when I wrote my post. Two great minds, what can I say?) Jason has more emphasis on the labor law implications of the Yelp situation.
