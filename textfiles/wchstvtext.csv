Representative Kevin Sinnette, D-Ashland, and Representative Jill York, R-Grayson, are sponsoring bi-partisan legislation that gives the company some tax incentives to make upgrades to its Ashland plant.  It also gives the A.K. Steel time to do it. The bill was introduced in the Kentucky Legislature in Frankfort on Monday, and it will be assigned to a committee.  It's another attempt to keep A.K. Steel in Eastern Kentucky. Last December, the layoffs started at A.K. Steel, and the community is feeling the impact. ""For every one person that got laid off there, it affects seven other people in the community, so with that being said, you take 600-plus people laid off from the union side and how many from the salary side that's quite a few people,"" said Scott Conley, president of United Steelworkers of America Local Union 1865 in Ashland. Now Kentucky state lawmakers are doing what they can to save the plant. Sinnette and York are sponsoring a bill that gives A.K. Steel a reason to upgrade its Ashland operations and time to do it. ""We would be able to set aside the sales and use taxes that would be normally charged on materials, supplies to repair replacement parts, and things like that.  As an incentive we would forgo those,"" York said. Conley of the Steelworkers said it is encouraging ""our local representatives have went to bat for us,"" pointing out the damage from the layoffs has already been done. ""People are uproooting, moving to other states, moving to other parts of Kentucky or wherever trying to find employment,"" Conley said. Supporters hope the bill has a quick path through the Kentucky Legislature. 2026 Sinclair, Inc."
