Several horses have been seized and charges could be filed against the owners. Now, the eight horses are in the financial care of the Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Group. The group and sheriff's office have made two rescues in less than a week. First, they seized two horses from Chapmanville last Thursday where a horse died. Then, they moved onto another herd of horses in Pecks Mill, where six horses were rescued. ""Really it was urgent, they had no body fat left, they didn't have access to food and water and I really believe had they waited several days they would have started to die one by one or in mass,"" founder of the Heart of Phoenix Tinia Creamer said. Creamer said the vet believes it was extreme starvation. ""Push down it should be up here so the amount of fat that this animal has lost is very substantial,"" Creamer said. Creamer said it's important to recognize what neglect looks like so you can report it to your local sheriff's department or animal control officers. If you compare one of the seized horses to a healthy horse the difference is obvious. ""You can feel a layer of fat over the spine, you don't see ribs or feel them. Then, he has this fat rump so this is what a healthy horse should look like it doesn't matter what the age is it makes no difference,"" Creamer said. Even though it's been a hectic several days for everyone involved, the volunteers said they love doing it. ""It's the most gratifying thing I've ever done horses have meant the world to me all my life. They've done so many things for emotionally so this is a way for me to give back,"" volunteer Susan Sunday said. ""It was just a really good week of people coming together, including the law enforcement, animal control, prosecutors, volunteers and the community,"" Creamer said.
