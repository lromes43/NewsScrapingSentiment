After kicking off the Green Bond market in 2007 with the issuance and listing of the first bond of this sort, the European Investment Bank has originated the 100th Green Bond listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

This issuance follows the impulse given by the agreement reached during the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP 21) to further develop and promote climate action in the developing world.
