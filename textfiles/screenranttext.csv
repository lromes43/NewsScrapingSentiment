2016-02-26,"When Deadpool was released a few weeks ago, no one thought it would be such a box office juggernaut, as the superhero movie took in $132 million domestically. Following its meteoric success, Fox immediately greenlit the sequel, which is currently in development with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick penning a new script and Tim Miller likewise expected back in the director's chair on Deadpool 2. The post-credits sequence at the end of Deadpool teased what's to come in the sequel with the Merc with the Mouth directly telling the audience that Cable, a fan-favorite, would appear in the new movie. While the role has yet to be cast, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) joked that actors like Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, and even Kiera Knightly could play Cable in Deadpool 2. We know the new sequel will feature Cable in a prominent role, but rumors have already started to spread, regarding which other characters from the X-Men comic books will show up. According to Heroic Hollywood, the character Neena Thurman aka Domino may well be featured in Deadpool 2. The character, for those not familiar, is a former mercenary, who turned into a member of the X-Men; not to mention, she's also Cable's on-again/off-again lover. Domino has the mutant ability to manipulate luck as an expert marksman and has appeared in a number of issues of the Cable & Deadpool comic books series. She was also a member of the first X-Force team with Wolverine as its leader.   Interestingly, Domino first appeared in the comic books as the mutant Copycat's (AKA Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle) impersonation. While she didn't take the Copycat persona in the movie, Morena Baccarin portrayed Vanessa in Deadpool, so it's going to be interesting if the sequel would follow the mythology from the comic books with Baccarin taking the role of Copycat, as she could impersonate Domino in Deadpool 2 if so. Rob Liefeld, Deadpool and Cable co-creator, also created Domino, so it's easy to see why she might be featured in Deadpool 2 and how she'd fit in with the existing movie and universe. It would make sense for Fox to fully expand Deadpool's film world with new characters, while also introducing new elements of X-Force (which may get a film adaptation) and The New Mutants (which has a film adaptation in active development) into the X-Men Cinematic Universe. Although there's actually a pretty good chance that Domino will appear in Deadpool 2, you should take this early report as a rumor with a grain of salt until it's confirmed by additional sources. Deadpool is now in theaters; X-Men: Apocalypse opens on May 27, 2016; Gambit sometime in 2017; Wolverine 3 on March 3, 2017; and an unannounced X-Men film on July 13, 2018. The New Mutants and Deadpool 2 are also in development.
