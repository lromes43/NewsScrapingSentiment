Based on one of the largest AI visibility studies in the industry, SOAR gives communicators a practical model for building press releases that AI can understand, trust, and cite. Built into GlobeNewswire, SOAR helps ensure your news is optimized before it’s measured, tracked, or amplified. Track your news across ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI answer engines.
