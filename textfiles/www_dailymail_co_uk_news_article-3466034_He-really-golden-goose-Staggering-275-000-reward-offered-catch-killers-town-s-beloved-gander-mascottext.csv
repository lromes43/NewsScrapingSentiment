The bird, known fondly as 'Goose' sadly died on Sunday, amid reports from villagers that he was shot in the head with an air rifle by a man leaning out of a 4x4 vehicle. His death has sparked a national outcry among animal lovers who heard he became part of the community in Sandon, Hertfordshire, where he even features on the village welcome sign. Listeners to a radio show have offered £275,000 to hunt down the killers of 'Goose' the gander, pictured The popular gander was shot in the head with an air rifle on Sunday in Sandon, Hertfordshire Local residents, including four-year-old Michelle Imura, pictured, have been devastated by the killing Earlier today two members of the public contacted the BBC's Jeremy Vine Show to offer rewards to catch the culprits - £250,000 from a Peter Hunt in Eastbourne, Sussex, and £25,000 from John Barker in Cambridge. Texting into the show, Mr Hunt said: 'I would like to offer £250,000 to whoever catches the vile killers of the goose so long as it leads to a conviction. 'This incident makes me feel sick.' And after calling in to the Radio 2 lunchtime programme, Mr Barker said: 'I am very upset about the whole situation. 'They are utterly scumbags and toerags. 'If the people responsible hand themselves in I will write them a cheque and hand it to them personally. 'They have taken the law into their own hands.' Despite initially stating an investigation would not be launched, police have since confirmed officers are to dig up his body so tests can take place to confirm how the bird died. Jeremy Vine, pictured, was discussing the killing on his show when two listeners pledged the £275,000 reward A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'At this stage we are unable to confirm how the goose died. We have no evidence to suggest it was shot, although there are rumours about this. 'We will be speaking with local residents to try and establish if there are any witnesses because at the moment we only have third-party reports. 'To confirm how the goose died we need to examine the body - the Royal Veterinary College would be used - and carry out a post mortem. Unfortunately, prior to officers attending the body had been removed and buried. 'We now have information suggesting where the goose is and this is currently being followed-up by officers. 'If the body is examined and it can be confirmed the bird was shot this would of course be investigated (again jointly by police and RSPCA).' Following the goose's untimely demise at the weekend, villagers flocked to the disused telephone box where he set up home after being orphaned as a gosling, to leave flowers and tributes in his honour. Locals have set up a shrine inside a disused telephone box in the centre of the historic village, pictured Small children have been particularly affected by the death of the goose, who lived in the village Emily Levy wrote: 'Dear angry goose, I love you to bits. I'm very sorry you died so suddenly. 'Love you, please come back some day.' Cerys Brey said: 'To dear old Mr Goose, I will miss seeing you. 'My mum said when you popped your tongue out and made that noise it was coz (sic) you loved the ducks and your home. 'I like that you wos (sic) brave to help wot you love and helped the ducks cross the road. 'Don't wrurry (sic). Me and my friends will look after them for you now. 'Love from Cerys E Brey.' Goose and was never formally named because many of his named predecessors were run over and they didn't wish to jinx his fate. The 400 parishioners who had come to love the bird over more than a decade were sickened to hear reports that he had fallen victim to the cruel attack on Sunday afternoon. Goose was never formally named as his predecessors all suffered an unfortunate end, including his parents, who were mutilated by a fox some 11 years ago. Goose spent much of his time in an old phone box Moments after seeing him gunned down, they rushed to his aid before burying him next to the village pond, where he would often be seen taking baby goslings under his wing. PR consultant Gay Ayton, 55, said: 'He was a great character and the villagers are going from sad to angry to sickened that people could have done this to him. 'There's no way it could have been someone who lives here. We've all come to love The Goose, despite him being a bit moody in mating season. 'We want this person to be named and shamed for what they did. It's disgusting that someone who is clearly well trained in using a gun, chose to harm an innocent goose in this way. 'It's nothing short of barbaric and the only reassuring thing is that the poor goose would not have suffered.' The Goose was born in the village 11 years ago but was sadly orphaned as a youngster after his parents were mauled to death by a fox. He took shelter in the village's decommissioned phonebox, where he would grow angry during the mating season which falls between February and March because he could see his own reflection which he believed was another bird. RSPCA Inspector Stephen Reeves said: 'I am appalled at this alleged incident. It is a reckless and senseless act to shoot a goose in the head at point blank range. 'I would urge anyone in the local area who may have seen this upsetting incident to come forward and to call the RSPCA's appeal line on 0300 123 8018. 'And I would also like to remind everyone that it is illegal under the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) to intentionally kill or injure any wild bird, and you can be prosecuted.' PR consultant Gay Ayton, 55, said: 'He was a great character and the villagers are going from sad to angry' It emerged that a village committee had recently announced plans to evict the fiercely territorial bird, moving Goose into a special box beside the village pond so a defibrillator could be put inside the phone box. Mystery also surrounded the whereabouts of the couple who said they witnessed the attack, blaming occupants of a blue 4x4. The pair, who recently moved to the village, told another resident who alerted George Walbridge. Mr Walbridge, who has lived in Sandon for 28 years, retrieved Goose’s body from the pond and buried it nearby. ‘There was damage to his left eye but just the eye and only on one side,’ he said. ‘We called the police. They didn’t want to know.’ Mr Walbridge said he had been left in an ‘absolute rage’ by the incident, although he acknowledged that many people had been troubled by Goose’s ‘extremely aggressive’ behaviour. Police officers dug up Goose’s remains yesterday to be sent to the Royal Veterinary College for a post-mortem examination. The £250,000 reward for information on the ‘vile killers’ was offered by Radio 2 listener Peter Hunt, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, who said the incident made him feel sick. Another listener, John Barker, from Cambridge, pledged a reward of £25,000 if anybody came forward with information on the killers. ‘I am very upset about this situation,’ he said. ‘They are scumbags and toe-rags doing this to animals.’ Goose’s early life was marked by tragedy when his mother was killed by a fox shortly after he hatched 11 years ago. He eventually became a focal point of village life, occasionally wandering into exercise classes in the village hall, chasing off foxes and sometimes letting children pat him. Jean Handley, a retired headmistress, said: ‘He’s been around for years and everybody is really upset about it. ‘He was certainly a village character. We all tended to avoid that postbox and go to the other one.’ "
