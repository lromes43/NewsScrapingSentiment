2016-02-26,"Just meet here for great meats We just love uncovering really cool, under the radar hangout spots. So you can imagine our delight when we began receiving reports from folks consistently spotting Metro D’s very best chefs and restaurant owners in the same section of Eastern Market. Could it be a new coffee house? A really dope breakfast eatery? Nope. It’s Fairway Packing Co., an old-style meat packing house with state-of-the-art technology and a client list that reads like a who’s who in Michigan restaurants, including chef Luciano DelSignore (Bacco), chef Damian Yopek (Rugby Grille), chef Francesco Apollonia (Bella Piatti), and Jeremy Sasson from both Townhouse restaurants, to name just a few. Five years ago today, Emmet and Gino Baratta, who run the family business started by their parents in the 1980s, unveiled a dry aging room. This has a lot to do with the exquisite steak offerings we’ve seen at restaurants lately with price tags starting at around $80 a plate. Even the Rugby Grille’s $55 Foie Burger starts from the galleries of Fairway Packing. “We process some of the finest quality meat in the world on a daily basis,” explains Emmet Baratta. “Michigan chefs demand quality because their guests expect nothing less. Failing to meet those standards is not an option for us.” Aging at Fairway is done by racking meat in a controlled environment that concentrates the flavor. Happy anniversary to the Fairway Packing dry aging room. Michigan meat lovers salute you. Choo-choo! Unique jewelry estate sale coming up Noted Michigan businessman, car collector and former CEO of Lionel Trains Richard Kughn has chosen Birmingham jeweler Brian Schubot to sell the jewelry of his late wife, Linda, who died in October. The unique collection (which appropriately includes lots of train-themed items) will be sold at auction at Joseph DuMouchelle on March 11. “It’s a magnificent collection of jewelry,” says Schubot. “From her very affordable everyday pieces like gold chains and decorative pins, to exquisite one-of-a-kind items like a 19-carat, heart-shaped diamond or her 10-carat Burma ruby ring.” Interested parties are given the opportunity for a sneak preview of the jewelry from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday at Joseph DuMouchelle in Birmingham. Schubot says there are more than 100 pieces in the collection at a wide variety of price points.
