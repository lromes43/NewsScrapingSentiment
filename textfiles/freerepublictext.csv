Posted on 02/26/2016 4:59:44 AM PST by rightwingintelligentsia Some American readers, observing the wide range of telly shows I've been doing in Australia, have written to ask why I'm not on US TV more. Well, the short answer is I never get asked. The phone never stops not ringing. I make no complaint about that: I'm a foreigner and I have no ambitions in American media. But Ann Coulter has a very funny column on some of the chaps who do get asked: 
If you tuned into ABC'S ""This Week"" the morning after Trump's tremendous victory in South Carolina, you'd find George Stephanopoulos promising analysis from a ""powerhouse roundtable,"" by which I assume he was referring to the table itself.
 I confess that when I occasionally see some of these bluechip Sunday morning shows it boggles the mind what ABC, CBS and NBC are willing to pay for. In the final debate before the New Hampshire primary, George Stephanopoulos' ""powerhouse roundtable"" included Cokie Roberts, who offered the stunning insight that as she saw it after Tuesday night a lot of the focus would be moving away from New Hampshire toward South Carolina. 
 That at least had the merit of being accurate. It's when they stray away from statements of the incontrovertible that it all goes to hell: 
[Stephanopoulos] then turned to the sort of clueless morons who have gotten everything wrong for the past seven months so they could tell viewers ""what's next""... (Excerpt) Read more at steynonline.com ... “powerhouse roundtable,” aka a##holes on parade I love Mark Steyn but he complains about whatever country he is currently abiding in. Is he now considering moving to Australia? He’s threatened to move to Sweden and now Australia, maybe? Plus, he subs all the time for Rush and appears on Fox frequently. Ann Coulter actually has been shut out of Fox. Coulter’s column was a killer because, as usual, it simply questioned the advertising hype. Re: Cokie Roberts...have never understood her employment, the prestige afforded her or her all too frequent appearances. She is, as Steyn notes, a blank-eyed ventriloquist dummy for the most tepid conventional wisdom and mastery of the bleeding obvious. One sign of life, however, is her seething hatred for the GOP and especially GOP voters. Her op ed columns are cowritten with her sad sack husband, apparently because it takes both of them to churn out 500 words of bile that make Debbie Wasserman Schultz look like George Will. She is a nasty piece of work. I have not seen any of these shows since I dumped TV in 1997. I can only imagine what they’ve digressed to. Hahahaha.. Steyn. Always blunt. thanks for that post; I needed to smile this morning. Exactly the same here, even the same year. I didn't mean for that to rhyme, it just worked out that way (this time.) I dumped TV in ‘95. It’s great! My braincells have almost recovered. Nice. You’re a poet and didn’t know it. “I love Mark Steyn but he complains about whatever country he is currently abiding in. Is he now considering moving to Australia? Heâ€™s threatened to move to Sweden and now Australia, maybe?” I have no idea what you are talking about. And neither do you I’d dare say. Monty Python: Upper class twit of the year contest skit. (Somebody could do a voice-over with our GOPe RINO twits.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ba1OKY7Xc I punted my TV in 1992. The other day, my kid called to say she got an A on her Quantum Mechanics exam and thanked me for ridding her life of that poison lo those many moons ago.
BTW, that didn’t rhyme. ‘I’m a poet and you wouldn’t think it!’  I think I saw Lincoln Chaffee in that skit. One sign of life, however, is her seething hatred for the GOP and especially GOP voters. Her op ed columns are cowritten with her sad sack husband, apparently because it takes both of them to churn out 500 words of bile that make Debbie Wasserman Schultz look like George Will."" AWESOME!! Re: Cokie’s employment as a pundit: Cokie is a Beltway insider. Her parents both served in Congress. Nicknamed after their favorite nose candy I’ll wager. Oh, I still enjoy the TV. I came to realization ages ago, regardless of channel, it’s ALL “entertainment”; and, too many hours watching WILL kill motivation as well as brain cells. Steyn is clearly on our side! Would like to see him on his own radio station. Disclaimer:
