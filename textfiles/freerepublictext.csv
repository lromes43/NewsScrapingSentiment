2016-02-26,"Skip to comments. Posted on 02/25/2016 3:56:41 PM PST by drewh Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince have released a bombshell report about former President Bill Clinton that could end Hillaryâ€™s campaign! In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President â€œfavored unprotected sex.â€ And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and â€œnew dietâ€ but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies. As Rush Limbaugh opined, looking at Bill Clinton on the campaign trail, Rush only sees Preparation H, Geritol, Fixodent, and Depends. Bill Clinton looks like his health is on a rapid recline. Bill Clinton is roughly the same age as President George W. Bush. But while Bush looks healthy, Clinton only becomes older and frail. Even a former Clinton White House advisor admits Bill looks unhealthy and â€œwashed-upâ€:  Former Bill Clinton advisor and television personality Dick Morris thinks his old boss isnâ€™t looking too good these days.  â€œI didnâ€™t recognize the character that was on TV,â€ Morris said of Bill Clintonâ€™s recent interview with NBC News in a video released Monday. â€œHe was washed-out, he was listless, he was apathetic, he was very slow-talking and even slower thinking!â€ Here is a picture of Clinton recently appearing on CNN with an unexplained lesion on his forehead. Very strange:

I used to ask my Democrat neighbors around the hood , after the Lewinsky scandal , if they would eat a hamburger made by Bill Clinton.
None of them would. But they still voted Democrat, which is the nature of their affliction....all hat and no cattle.

Old BJ is a pretty busy guy.
I’m about the same age and I know I couldn’t keep up his schedule, LOL.
When I visited the Clinton POTUS Library in Little Rock last year, they mentioned that he occasionally teaches classes at the Univ of Arkansas School of Government which is located on the grounds. Then Bill invites “friends” up to the 4th floor “love nest” as Rush calls it.

First of all, why would Hillary demand he get tested for HIV? She hasn’t slept with him in decades?
Second, I’ve thought he looks like an AIDS patient. I can’t stand the guy but I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.

First of all, why would Hillary demand he get tested for HIV? She hasn’t slept with him in decades?
Second, I’ve thought he looks like an AIDS patient. I can’t stand the guy but I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.

FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As Rush Limbaugh opined, looking at Bill Clinton on the campaign trail, Rush only sees Preparation H, Geritol, Fixodent, and Depends. Bill Clinton looks like his health is on a rapid recline. Bill Clinton is roughly the same age as President George W. Bush. But while Bush looks healthy, Clinton only becomes older and frail. Even a former Clinton White House advisor admits Bill looks unhealthy and â€œwashed-upâ€:  Former Bill Clinton advisor and television personality Dick Morris thinks his old boss isnâ€™t looking too good these days.  â€œI didnâ€™t recognize the character that was on TV,â€ Morris said of Bill Clintonâ€™s recent interview with NBC News in a video released Monday. â€œHe was washed-out, he was listless, he was apathetic, he was very slow-talking and even slower thinking!â€ Here is a picture of Clinton recently appearing on CNN with an unexplained lesion on his forehead. Very strange:

....that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex. Now it's corrected:  ""....that Bill raped so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor.

I used to ask my Democrat neighbors around the hood , after the Lewinsky scandal , if they would eat a hamburger made by Bill Clinton.
None of them would. But they still voted Democrat, which is the nature of their affliction....all hat and no cattle.

Old BJ is a pretty busy guy.
I’m about the same age and I know I couldn’t keep up his schedule, LOL.
When I visited the Clinton POTUS Library in Little Rock last year, they mentioned that he occasionally teaches classes at the Univ of Arkansas School of Government which is located on the grounds. Then Bill invites “friends” up to the 4th floor “love nest” as Rush calls it.

....that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex. Now it's corrected:  ""....that Bill raped so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor.

I used to ask my Democrat neighbors around the hood , after the Lewinsky scandal , if they would eat a hamburger made by Bill Clinton.
None of them would. But they still voted Democrat, which is the nature of their affliction....all hat and no cattle.

Old BJ is a pretty busy guy.
I’m about the same age and I know I couldn’t keep up his schedule, LOL.
When I visited the Clinton POTUS Library in Little Rock last year, they mentioned that he occasionally teaches classes at the Univ of Arkansas School of Government which is located on the grounds. Then Bill invites “friends” up to the 4th floor “love nest” as Rush calls it.

First of all, why would Hillary demand he get tested for HIV? She hasn’t slept with him in decades?
Second, I’ve thought he looks like an AIDS patient. I can’t stand the guy but I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
