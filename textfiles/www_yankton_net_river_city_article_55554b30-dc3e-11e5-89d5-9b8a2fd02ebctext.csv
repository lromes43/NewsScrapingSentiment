Updated: February 24, 2026 @ 11:14 pm  The Yankton Area Concert Association, as part of its current series of concerts, will present the Maniacal4 Trombone Quartet at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 27, at the YHS/Summit Activities Center Theater. The Maniacal4 is a fabulous group of four great musicians, telling one unified, inspiring musical story after another. Hailed as “a force to be reckoned with,” the trombone quartet has performed on three continents, entertaining audiences with a wide range of styles and time periods. Maniacal4 is well versed in a variety of musical styles including classical, jazz, Latin and light rock, and performs its concerts almost exclusively from memory, projecting a clear, unified, uplifting and committed musical vision to its audiences. M4’s programs reach from Bach, Beethoven and Mozart to Roy Orbison’s “Pretty Woman,” Fillmore’s “Lassus Trombone,” Debussy’s “Girl With the Flaxen Hair” and “The Russian Sailor’s Dance.” Trained at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas – one of the premier jazz schools in the United States – these four outstanding musicians have the goods to become one of the world’s finest trombone quartets. This performance is an opportunity to hear one of the really great trombone quartets in existence today and what a treat – especially if you played the trombone in your high school band.
