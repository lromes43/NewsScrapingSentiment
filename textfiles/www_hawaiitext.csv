2016-02-26,"The ʻImiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaiʻi, a world-class science education center, opened its doors ten years ago on the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo campus. On February 21, center ʻohana and community members celebrated with a day of food, fun and free activities for all ages. The center’s interactive exhibits, 3D full dome planetarium, native landscape, programs and events engage children, families and the local community in the wonders of science and technology found in Hawaiʻi. Reflecting on the past and excited for what lies ahead ʻImiloa’s Executive Director Kaʻiu Kimura shared, “In the first ten years of ʻImiloa’s existence here in the community, we worked hard to provide educational opportunities that shared different perspectives regarding Maunakea, astronomy and our Hawaiian culture. In the next 10, we are looking at how we can bring these different perspectives together to learn from one another and have more of a collective approach to educating our community.” While ʻImiloa hopes to grow, expand and enhance the way it impacts community in the future, inspiring these new generations of learners is something that will never change. “The one thing that will continue to be a consistent here at ʻImiloa is how we reflect our name, ʻImiloa— this notion of always on this perpetual search for knowledge; not knowledge for knowledge’s sake but knowledge for the enrichment and empowerment of our community.”     Student-Athletes, Coaches, Community Testify on NIL Have a story idea or a question?Contact news@hawaii.edu If required, information contained on this website can be made available in an alternative format upon request.
