A strong high pressure front from China has extended over Thailand and the South China Sea and is likely to blanket the country until Feb 28. It will cause temperatures in the North to drop between 1-3 degree Celsius and 1-2 degrees Celsius in the Northeast, the Central Plain and East during the period, according to the weather forecast issued today. The northeast monsoon across the Gulf of Thailand and the South is intensifying. Strong winds and waves between 2-4 metres are expected to hit the Gulf of Thailand during this period. The department warned that people should beware of onshore surf. All ships should proceed with caution and small boats should stay ashore between today and Sunday. Between Feb 29 and March 2, the high pressure areas covering upper part of Thailand are expected to weaken, the department predicted.
