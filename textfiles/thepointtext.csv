motivated him to come up with the four-track album entitled: “Mansa Feleh.” He
said President Jammeh is a man of peace and wisdom and “has developed the
country beyond expectations”. “President
Jammeh has done a lot for this country and has transformed it to a modern
state,” Soraman added. “He has also made the Gambians all over the world proud
because of his noble deeds and leadership qualities.” © 2026  The Point"
