2016-02-26,"We have now been in Australia for ten days. A fact that might surprise those of you who  remember my comments made on previous visits to this country. It is not my comments on the country itself that have got me into trouble. I enjoy its beauty, relish its beaches and admire at least two of its cities. No, it is my comments on the population that have caused many of my readers to chastise me in the past. So this time, anxious to avoid your ire,  I am going to restrict my comments to just a few words and let my photographs do the talking First of all I would like to introduce you to the Australian Bush turkey.   It grew up in the Australian bush (hence it’s clever name thought up by one of the more intelligent locals)  but its population exploded and looking for new pastures it has ventured into the cities and towns. It is as you can see a singularly unattractive bird. Other larger equally unattractive turkeys have done  also moved into the cities   The bush turkey can be found on the streets and sidewalks, in the bushes and parks, always foraging for food   The much larger Australian Turkey does the same   The larger turkey is proud of its ancestry and often advertises that at least one of its body part bears a striking resemblance to its smaller relative.   A  few years ago I might have let my comments come to a close right there. But I now recognise that my views are biased and one sided. There are many wonderful inhabitants of this land. Some of them strikingly beautiful . The rainbow lorikeet is a wonderful example. It is one of the most beautiful birds and it inhabits many areas of Australia. In Queensland where we are, it is easy to spot huge flocks of them. They are everywhere and even visit us on our balcony   There are so many of them  that they are regarded as a pest. But when they display and flaunt their colours, one can only appreciate them for what they are  The same can be said for the much larger Australian bird  Australia is also known for its culinary delights Shrimps on the barbie, is a delicacy now recognized around the world  But these clever Australians have now found something else to do with the barbie    And, with that, dear reader,we will leave the delights of Australia and head on over to Bali How wonderfully wicked. Fabulousity/sardonic meter is ticking wildly. I read this with some trepidation….. and thankfully realise that several turkeys had been omitted….. pleased the Rainbow Lorikeet was featured….. enjoy Bali! It’s Bush Turkey free I believe! Loved those turkeys! What was your itinerary in Australia? xoxo Colette, we spent 4 days in Sydney and then 6 days in Mooloolaba (yes, there is a place called Mooloolaba) an hour north of Brisbane where we were visiting a friend who has just moved there. Thanks for the enjoyable blog, you have brightened an otherwise dull afternoon.  Safe travels Mim What could be better than to be told I have brightened someone’s dull afternoon?
