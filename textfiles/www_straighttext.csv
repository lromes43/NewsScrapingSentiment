2016-02-26,"Music Features  Thirty years from now, when Kanye West is finally ready for retirement, folks will look back on the rapper as one of the greatest of all time for more than his music. If the past month has proven anything, it's that Kanye West and his endless controversies are the gift that keeps on giving. Such are the MC's powers that he can get a respected Canadian producer in one part of the country taking an articulate, impassioned, and entirely deserved shot at a music industry giant in the other. Tonight, Juno-nominated Vancouver producer and MC Matt Brevner posted a letter on Facebook apologizing to the world for Ezrin. Not for the fact that the 66-year-old Torontonian produced records by Kiss and Alice Cooper, but instead for coming out and suggesting that Yeezy is nowhere near the artist that M.C. Hammer was. First, a bit of background. On Tuesday, Ezrin posted a blog where he stated no one will remember West's ""sophomoric"" songs in 20 years, adding, ""He didn't open up new avenues of public discourse like NWA or introduce the world to a new art form like Grandmaster Flash or even meaningfully and memorably address social issues through his music like Marshall, Macklemore and Kendrick."" West was quick to fire back with Tweets that first asked who Ezrin was, and then suggested that he halt all discourse with the rapper. He then suggested that Ezrin's kids—who, if Ezrin has any, might very well be in their 40s--are ashamed of their father. That exchange didn't go unnoticed on the coast, with Brevner weighing in on Facebook in defence of Kanye, and to issue an apology to the world on behalf of Vancouver's urban artists. Above all, it should be noted that the West Coast producer kept things classy by praising Ezrin as ""talented and accomplished"". But Brevner also goes on to say that Ezrin's comments made him ""sick to his stomach"", partly because they came from a Canadian music industry icon. Rather than quote Brevner's letter in bits and pieces, we'll post the whole Facebook letter below. Your move Bob Ezrin. And thank you Kanye for keeping the world interesting. After you're finished reading, check out Brevner's latest video below, which comes from his new EP, Brevner, available here. Here's the post, which can also be found here: An open letter to Mr. Bob Ezrin On behalf of the next generation of urban artists from Vancouver, BC, I feel the need to apologize on behalf of our city and let it be known that Mr. Bob Ezrin does not represent us or speak for us in any way. After reading your blog post Mr. Ezrin, and knowing that Mr. West had seen it and responded to it, truly made me feel embarrassed for my city for the first time in my life. To infer that Macklemore and MC Hammer have had more of a cultural effect on hip-hop music than Kanye West is near blasphemy. To say that Kanye West isn't an artist is not only ridiculous, it's offensive. What then defines an artist Mr Ezrin? Long before this new era of where, to use your words Mr. Ezrin, ""you can be a star today by just creating a public life that people pay attention to…"" where "" all you have to do is be interesting or likeable or shocking enough and you can have your 15 minutes of fame"", Mr. West changed the cultural landscape of our genre. In a time where gangster rap reigned supreme, a metrosexual fashionista with a ""pink polo and a backpack"" changed the criteria of what a rapper looks like. Talking on subjects like working a minimum wage job and exposing your deepest insecurities for all of the world to see was something that the hip-hop world would have previously considered a career ender. To be frank, there is no Macklemore, Lupe Fiasco, Kendrick Lamar, ( you could even argue that there is no Jay-z as we know him today ) without Kanye's influence on the art form. Yes, hip-hop IS an art form and yes, Kanye west IS an artist. To state that you just don't get it would be a severe understatement. It boggles my mind and truly saddens me that someone as talented and accomplished as yourself could be so ignorant. Artists like myself coming from Western Canada look to you as a member of our industry's vanguard, which is why reading your statement truly made me feel sick to my stomach. It read as the ramblings of an out-of-touch father in the 50's who thought that the Beatles made bad music because they had funny haircuts. Clearly Sir Paul understands, and to quote him directly, he stated that "" writing with Kanye West is like working with John Lennon."" Sadly you are completely missing the point. To say that ""Kanye's greatest achievements have been in the form of excessive behaviour, egomaniacal tantrums and tasteless grandstanding"" must mean that his 21 grammies don't mean shit. I beg to differ. I hate to break it to you, but over 75 percent of the attendees of your school are paying your bills so that they can hope to grow up and have one tenth of the cultural impact that Kanye West has had. How do you not understand that? Charging kids tens of thousands of dollars for an education that provides no guaranteed job placement or income after is a form of ""culture vulturey"" that I could never condone nor understand. You are quite literally bankrupting children in the name of ""hopes and dreams"". In my opinion, a non for profit structure would be a much more genuine way to truly ""give back"" to your community, but who am I to judge? Get your money, Bob. I am not writing this to defend the antics or personality of someone whom I have never met, but to make clear that ones antics / personality / lifestyle does not in any way dictate the quality of their art. Does John Lennon's homophobic and anti semetic past make him a bad songwriter? Does Kurt Cobain's struggle with drug abuse make Nirvana less impactful? Does Elton John being gay make him lesser of a pianist? Does Ali's rhetoric make him less of a boxer? Does Tiger woods sexual addiction make him an average golfer? Did Jimi Hendrix's drug problem mean he was a shit guitar player? I could go on but I'm hoping that you get my point by now. I understand that this may be seen as opportunistic, but I am honestly just reacting to the situation in real time as it develops, as I feel a duty and responsibility to clear the black eye that you have brought upon the creatives of our city. We need to be encouraging to the artists and next generation of talent. We need to lead by example, and give credit where credit is due. If you, Mr. Ezrin, were from anywhere in the world other than Vancouver, I wouldn't have given your words any weight, or taken personal offence to them. This isn't about Kanye West, this is about Vancouver. It concerns me greatly that you are shaping the next generation of artists from our city, and letting them know that if they don't fit into the mould which you have set forth for what an artist should look like, that they are inadequate. That is purely incorrect, and you sir with all do respect are out of touch. Regards, Brevner. Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip once suggested that he would like to fight Mike Usinger. For which Mike Usinger didn't blame him one bit. Am I looking at this thing?
Mommy why'm I tow toopid? I saw you play with Earthball at 2024 Jazz Fest. Long tangly hair and a forest-green guitar you..."
