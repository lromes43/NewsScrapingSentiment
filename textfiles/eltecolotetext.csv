The spill affected at least eight Achuar tribes that rely on the now contaminated water.  On Monday Feb. 22, a collective of actors, actresses and dancers led by actor and playwright Richard Torres, gave a performance in which they showcased an imminent death of the Amazon jungle at the hand of Petroperu. The number of attendees doubled on the second day of protests on Feb. 23. Protesters marched around the building and stopped by the Agency for Assessment and Environmental Control (OEFA) offices located behind Petroperu, where they demanded more legal action against the state-owned petroleum company. OEFA has fined the petroleum company $3.6 million for not having adequate facilities to maintain the pipeline. Another group entered the nearby road to ask drivers to join their cause by honking. Although the protests were directed to Petroperu officials, they were also meant to raise awareness about the recurring environmental emergencies in the country’s jungle regions. According to OEFA, at least 20 similar oil spills have occurred in the same region in the last five years. Petroperu, which daily transports 5,000 to 6,000 barrels of oil through their Northern Peruvian Pipeline, said in a statement that the rupture was caused by a landslide. In the last few weeks, Peruvian media reported that Petroperu had hired children from indigenous communities to collect the crude oil. Although this was denied by the company’s president, German Velasquez, he also announced the firing of one official who may have allowed children to participate in the cleanup operations. At least 300 members from local indigenous communities were hired by Petroperu to collect crude oil for $17.14 a day, while others were paid in food, as reported by Peruvian TV station Canal N. Petroperu admitted it will take up to a year to restore the damaged flora and fauna. Meanwhile, the president of Central Organization of Aguaruna Communities of the Alto Marañon, Luciana Dekentai, told Peruvian newspaper El Comercio that the central government is taking too long to provide aid for affected indigenous communities and that some people who may have drank contaminated water are starting to develop sore throats, fevers and body aches. “It’s a crime that has no forgiveness,” said Torres. “Flora and fauna are dying and all because of damned money, the power and the ego of a few people that rule my country.”       "
