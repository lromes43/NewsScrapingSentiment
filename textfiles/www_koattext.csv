2016-03-02,"It’s perfectly OK to walk into New Mexico’s capitol building, most commonly referred to as the Roundhouse, with a loaded gun. Two other state buildings in Santa Fe allow guns inside: the Bataan Building, which houses the Department of Cultural Affairs, the Department of Finance and Veterans Affairs, as well as the building that houses the tourism and engineering departments. ""New Mexico is a concealed-carry state,"" said Democratic Representative Brian Egolf of Santa Fe. ""We're also an open-carry state, and the state Capitol is not exempt from those laws."" It's not exempt, but firearms are not allowed inside the state Supreme Court, and it's the same at the Child Protective Services building. ""(The Roundhouse) is one of the most open and accessible capitols in the United States,"" Egolf said, ""and I and my colleagues definitely want to keep it that way."" Not everyone agrees, and law enforcement officials have their concerns. ""I don't think it's a great idea to bring guns in this environment because it's a controlled environment, and I'd hate to see an accident happen where one went off,"" said State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. Republican Don Tripp, who represents Socorro, said he also has concerns about Roundhouse security. Tripp supports gun rights and said at least half a dozen of his colleagues at the Roundhouse have conceal-carry permits. The question now is what kind of change could be coming? Lawmakers said they're in favor of adding metal detectors at Roundhouse entrances so they'd at least know who's walking in with guns. And there's also talk of banning guns, with the exception of law enforcement. Tripp said he wants restrictions. “We want to know who the people are who are doing the carrying,” Tripp said. So what do you think? Should the Roundhouse be open to guns? Vote in our poll.
