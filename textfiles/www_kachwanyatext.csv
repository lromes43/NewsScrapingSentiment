2016-02-26,"Google has made it possible for articles to load faster when you search them on Google search. The move will allow users who search for articles or topics using their mobile phone Web browser to be linked to Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Google provides that AMP pages load four times faster and take up 10 times less wireless data than a regular article page. It does this by loading the elements of an article more efficiently. For example, not loading an image at the bottom of an article until someone scrolls down to it, so the top of the story can load more quickly. Nowadays, lifestyle revolves around smartphones and other communication devices. People switched to reading content published on websites and viewing information from mobile apps. This has made web designers to develop catchy sites that can archive educative and entertaining content. The system can be used by anyone across the world, but The New York Times, BuzzFeed, The Guardian and the BBC are among the first content creators using the system. Information is very important and it enables people gain knowledge in a particular field of study. Just like Google, Facebook released a product called Instant Articles, for stories posted to its social network. The service allows users to load articles with ease whenever they are posted on Facebook thus improving efficiency. “It really changes your expectations for how you interact with content on the Web, and, frankly, search results,” said Rudy Galfi, a Google product manager. Google said it doesn’t know how many publishers and bloggers are using it because many publishers share their articles on the platform. Facebook, which also started out only working with a small group of publishers on Instant Articles, saw so much success that it will open the program up to everyone in April. The AMP system was announced in October and it allows pages to load faster by rethinking how article pages for smartphones are coded. “It’s absolutely still about relevancy,” said Galfi. “Speed is an important signal, but not the only one.” Comments are closed.
