Vithiya Alphons, 24, from Walthamstow, was told she had Acute Myeloid Leukaemia just days into her final year at Cardiff University. Doctors told Miss Alphons she needs a stem cell transplant in order to survive but she is yet to find a suitable donor after her brother Clime, 22, was only a 50 per cent match. The search has become more complex than most because of a lack of donors from South Asian backgrounds. The 24-year-old was told her best option was finding a more suitable, unrelated, donor in the next two months. To help matters, blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan has launched a worldwide appeal to help the young Londoner. Miss Alphons said: “It’s frustrating but I don’t think it’s about Asian people not wanting to sign up. “They just don’t know what it is. They think it’s taking something from your bone. We have to raise awareness.” Her friends and family have issued appeals on social media to help find a lifeline. Miss Alphons added: “I’ve been blown away by the support. I’ve had thousands of messages from people I don’t even know, saying they’ve signed up and are spreading the word. “Some of my friends are hoping to arrange donor drives at their universities. It’s been incredible.” Ann O’Leary, from Anthony Nolan, said: “Vithiya is a bright and inspirational young woman and somewhere out there, there’s a potential lifesaver who could give her a lifeline by donating their stem cells.
