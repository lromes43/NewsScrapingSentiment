A Freedom of Information request from this newspaper found that from 2013 to 2015, there were a total of 1128 assaults on healthcare staff in hospitals and health centres in Wishaw, Shotts, Newmains, Cleland, Motherwell and Carluke. Hard-working staff at Wishaw General Hospital were subjected to 930 attacks – 409 of those were committed in the past year. Data shows that in 2015, over 160 Wishaw General staff were assaulted by patients they were trying to help, almost 100 patients used threatening and intimidating behaviour to hospital workers and 15 staff were the victims of violent behaviour. Meanwhile, there were 72 incidents at Cleland Hospital, 71 at the Airbles Road Centre in Motherwell, while the health centres in Wishaw, Motherwell, Shotts, Newmains and Carluke noted 55 assaults between them. Across Lanarkshire, 4012 incidents took place on health workers with 1460 occurring in 2015. Meanwhile, figures supplied to the Wishaw Press from Police Scotland, showed that between 2013 and 2015, there were a total of 668 assaults on officers across the six council wards in the Wishaw and Motherwell area. More than half of these assaults – 394 – occurred in the Motherwell South East and Ravenscraig ward, which includes Craigneuk and Muirhouse. Ward councillor Gary O’Rorke put the huge figures down to the fact that both Motherwell town centre and a part of Wishaw Main Street make up some of the ward. Councillor O’Rorke said: “The ward is quite a large geographical area and whenever you have busy town centres you will always see a spike in figures. “Having said that, any attack on police officers is unacceptable. “The police are doing a tremendous job in bringing crime down in our area, it’s the lowest it has ever been.” In Wishaw itself there were 76 assaults on officers over the past three years. But last year’s figure of 19 was significantly lower than the 43 which was registered in 2013. However, worryingly, the council wards of Wishaw, Murdostoun, Motherwell West and Fortissat all saw a rise in the number of assaults over the past 12 months. The Scottish Police Federation represents over 18,500 police officers across Scotland. A spokeswoman said: “Sadly these statistics bear out what our members have been saying to us for some time now. The level of assaults are far too high. “There must be enough Police officers on the streets to dissuade criminals from launching attacks on them. ""Our principal aim is the protection of the public, but for us to be able to do that we must be able to protect ourselves. ""To do this judges and sheriffs need to understand that they have a large part to play in helping officer safety by sentencing appropriately and the chief constable must do all he can to provide and make available the best equipment for officers. “Officers being assaulted should never be accepted as just a hazard of the job.” The Wishaw Press contacted the North Lanarkshire branch of UNISON, one of the unions which represents hospital staff.
