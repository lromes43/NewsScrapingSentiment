2016-02-26,"Robin Hood in his flood damaged home. A man who was forced from his home by floodwater has accused the council of having “no common sense”. Robin Hood has been living in a caravan for almost two months since Storm Frank ruined his home near Mossdale. But he’s been unable to get relief from council tax payments, despite providing the local authority with photos of the damage. Mr Hood said: “There is no common sense or compassion. “I have had four letters from three different people to say my photographic evidence isn’t sufficient and they want a timeframe of the work. “The fourth letter tipped me over the edge. It is a real irritation. “I don’t want to pay something that I don’t have to pay. I’m not living there at the moment, the house is uninhabitable.” More than three feet of water inundated Mr Hood’s house on the banks of Loch Ken at new year, forcing him and his wife to salvage what they could and move it upstairs. In the wake of the floods, Mr Hood applied for, and received, a £1,500 grant from the Scottish Government through a scheme administered by the council.  Around three foot of floodwater got into Robin Hood's house on the banks of Loch Ken.  He also expected to have his council tax reduced since he wasn’t living at the property. But local authority officials say they need details of the start date for repair work on Mr Hood’s house before they can offer him the relief. He said: “My insurance company said my property was one of the worst affected in the area. “Hundreds of homes were hit but the insurance company is currently working in Carlisle before they get to Dumfries and Galloway. “The work can’t be done until the house is dried out. “I am currently living in a caravan at my friend’s. They are addressing letters to Robin Hood, care of the caravan at Corsock, so they know I’m there.” A council spokesman said: “It would be inappropriate to discuss an individual case through the media. “However, council tax is a property charge with a personal element, it is not a charge on occupation. “Council tax exemptions and discounts are prescribed by legislation. In order to qualify for them certain criteria must be met and some can only be granted for a set period of time. “Where the criteria are not met, local authorities have no discretion to award them. “We have a duty to protect the public purse and, as such, certain categories of exemption require documentary evidence to be submitted before we can apply them. The level of evidence we request is reasonable in all cases.” At  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.
