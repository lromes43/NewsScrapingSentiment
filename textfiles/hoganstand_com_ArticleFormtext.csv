2016-02-26,"Tyrone boss Mickey Harte says he is not a fan of introducing the 'mark' into Gaelic football and feels that the game should be left alone. Harte was speaking ahead of tomorrow's annual Congress in Carlow, where delegates will vote on numerous key issues with a motion for the 'mark' set to be tabled by the playing rules committee. The committee is chaired by former Armagh footballer Jarlath Burns, who feels the 'mark' is needed to ""protect the art of high fielding"" in the game, Harte, however, doesn't agree. ""I just do not see the point of bringing it into our game and the reasons that they suggest is to increase high-fielding,"" Harte told The Irish News. ""It won't do that because you won't let teams catch high-ball if they're going to have the freedom of the park when they get it, so there'll be more broken ball because of it. There is still high-fielding in the game. [But] I don't see why that should be the protected element of our game… The stop-start nature that it will bring would spoil the game. ""You only have to look at the Compromise Rules stuff - it was stop-start, boringly stop-start. You'd love someone to chair one of these committees and for them to say: leave the game alone.""           © DG Press"
