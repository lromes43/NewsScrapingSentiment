2016-02-26,"New signing Jeremy Helan can't wait to make his Wolves debut on Saturday - and is happy to play wherever Kenny Jackett wants. Wolves have snapped up the 23-year-old on a loan deal from Championship rivals Sheffield Wednesday until the end of the season. And the versatile Frenchman – who plays left-back or left wing and turned then-League One Wolves down to join Wednesday in 2013 – is delighted to be at Molineux. He said: ""When a club has shown interest in you in the past, and they still really like you, it gives you the confidence to perform. ""Wolves have shown faith in me, so as a player I'm going to give 100 per cent, that's the absolute minimum I can do for the team. ""I knew Kenny Jackett wanted me and what his plans were for me, so it was an easy decision to come here."" Helan wore the number three jersey in training yesterday, but Jackett has been coy on where the former Manchester City youngster will fit into his team. He added: ""Being able to play left-back and left midfield helps a lot. Either position I play, I'll give my best and that's the only way to go about it."" Wolves currently lack a senior specialist left-back or left winger in their squad. Jackett was delighted to bring Helan, who has played 139 times for Wednesday, in to help address that. He said: ""We've had problems in those positions through injuries. He has good Championship experience and is ready to go. He'll help with the balance of our team as a natural left-footer. ""Some pace down that side is something we've been looking for. He has experience in both positions, more probably in a wide left position. ""He has strong power and very good attributes for the league. I'm looking for him to be able to give us balance, pace and competitiveness down that side."""
