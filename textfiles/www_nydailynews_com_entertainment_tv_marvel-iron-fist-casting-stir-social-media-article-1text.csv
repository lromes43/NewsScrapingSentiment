The casting of “Game of Thrones” veteran Finn Jones, first reported by Entertainment Weekly, unleashed a flurry of criticism on social media because an Asian wasn’t chosen to play the martial arts expert. But the Iron Fist of the comic books, created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane in 1974, has always been white. The character’s alter ego, Daniel Rand, is a blond, blue-eyed orphan who is trained in the martial arts in the mystical city in the Himalayan mountains called K’un-L’un. One of the most high-profile detractors of Jones’ casting on social media has been one of Marvel’s own writers — Marjorie Liu. “Iron Fist is an orientalist-white-man-yellow-fever narrative,” she tweeted. “Asian actor would have helped subvert that offensive trope, and reclaim space.” “Dexter” alum Scott Buck is on board the “Iron Fist” series as a showrunner. The British-born Jones is best known on this side of the Pond for playing Ser Loras Tyrell on “Game of Thrones,” but also appeared opposite horror icon Robert Englund in the 2014 thriller, “The Last Showing.” It’s an important piece of casting for Marvel and Netflix. “Iron Fist” is part of the studio’s ambitious strategy to chronicle the comic publisher’s edgier characters. A second season of “Daredevil” drops on March 18, “Jessica Jones” recently bowed to positive reviews and a series based on Luke Cage is on the horizon. The four heroes will eventually band together in a “Defenders” event series that borrows a page from Marvel’s successful movie strategy uniting its Iron Man, Captain America and Thor franchises for the studio’s “Avengers” flicks. esacks@nydailynews.com Copyright 2026 New York Daily News.
