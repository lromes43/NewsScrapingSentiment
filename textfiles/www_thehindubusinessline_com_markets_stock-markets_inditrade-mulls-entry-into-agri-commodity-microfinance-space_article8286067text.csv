                          Special Arrangement Focussing on southern markets, financial services company Inditrade Capital is closely looking at opportunities in the agri commodity and micro-financing businesses. The company through its subsidiary JRG Fincorp has entered into agri commodity financing business in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. The opportunity in this under-serviced market is significant and the company hopes to rapidly scale up the loan book at around ₹300-400 crore, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, the promoter of the company, said. The commodity business in India, he said, is estimated at ₹10 lakh crore and close to 50 per cent is being funded by banks, and NBFCs, among others, and the remaining by unorganised money lenders. “We wanted to enter in an organised manner to fund the business,” he said. To a question on the recent fall in commodity prices, he said “it is a cycle and the demand is likely to remain strong.” However, in non-agri commodities, there has been stress and the subdued demand will stay for some more time, especially in the precious metals segment till the Chinese economy recovers. Asked whether the firm is shifting its focus from equity markets especially in these turbulent times, he replied in the negative, saying they would rapidly expand its broking and distribution business either directly or through its subsidiaries. “For the time being, we will remain in the southern markets and further improve presence both in online and onboard trading to provide a better experience to customers,” he said. The company is also working on tie ups with large telecom players and banks to rapidly scale up their broking and distribution business in South India. There are also plans to get into micro financing business to cater to the semi-urban market, he said. It may be recalled that Barings (India) PE Fund, the erstwhile controlling shareholders of Inditrade Capital, have exited and Sudip Bandyopadhyay along with two other investors acquired control of Inditrade last week. The public offer to minority stakeholders will remain open till March 1. Published on  February 26, 2016 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
