2016-02-26,"The actor was denounced for comments about the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. But might her remarks – and subsequent vilification – have endeared her to beleaguered Academy voters? When Charlotte Rampling voiced her opinion that the race debate engulfing this year’s Oscars was “racist to whites”, many presumed she had destroyed her chances of winning the award for which she’d only been nominated a week before. Yet analysts in Los Angeles believe Rampling could still be in contention to win best actress on Sunday. “I don’t rule it out at all,” says leading Oscars pundit Scott Feinberg of the Hollywood Reporter. “Regardless of whether they were well-chosen words, I think she probably earned more support than she lost.” Veteran film writer David Thomson agrees: “My guess is that any dismay at her remark on racial grounds is countered by other people saying: good for her.” Rampling goes into the race in fifth place, trailing Brie Larson (Room), Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn), Cate Blanchett (Carol) and Jennifer Lawrence (Joy). Bookies are currently quoting her at 66/1, Ronan at 1/20. “I would say the odds are extremely off,” says Feinberg. “Cate Blanchett has already won twice, including two years ago; as has Jennifer Lawrence, who was in a movie [voters] did not like at all. I’d put Rampling second or third.” If Rampling’s remarks seem likely to have struck a chord with anyone, it’s likely to be Academy members, unhappy not only at proposed rule changes which would remove voting rights from retirees, but also at the implication they are racist, incapable of voting for anyone other than fellow Caucasians. “The majority of them find that very offensive,” says Feinberg. “Especially two years after they awarded 12 Years A Slave best picture, and while they have an African-American woman leading their organisation.” While Rampling’s comments provoked outrage at the time, similar recent statements by the likes of Jamie Foxx suggesting the lack of black acting nominees might be down to their performances not making the grade, have been met more warmly, suggesting a groundswell of untapped support. “I think Rampling probably regrets phrasing it in the way that she did,” says David Paul Kirkpatrick, former president of Paramount and Disney, and a voter in the Academy’s executive wing. “But I believe there is truth to it.” He highlights that in the 1970s, the divisive activism of both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave did not prove a barrier to either winning an Oscar. “Redgrave was perceived as a big supporter of Palestinians – not exactly well received in Hollywood – and yet she won. People don’t necessarily vote with the liberal or the conservative cause.” Other Oscar voters are less convinced. Patricia Resnick, who wrote the film 9-5 – and also contributed to a serious of columns from disgruntled voters on The Hollywood Reporter – says, “I can’t see people supporting her as a sort of screw-you vote.” Many of her baby boomer peers in the Academy “were kind of upset, surprised” by Rampling’s interview, given to French radio. “I always think those of us in the entertainment industry are kind of shocked when someone seems to be somewhat right wing.” Yet surprise results often follow the assumption that favouritism dictates voting preference. Says Kirkpatrick: “If it were a popularity contest then Michael Keaton would have won over Eddie Redmayne last year.” That Rampling’s critically-acclaimed performance in brutal marital drama 45 Years was overlooked by other awards bodies, including the Golden Globes and the Baftas, also gives her the advantage of underdog status – as well as being an unknown quantity. “She has not really gone head to head with these people before,” says Feinberg. “And if anything she may have raised the profile of a movie that had significantly less promotion than her competitors.” If people are voting for Rampling, he reports, their concern is over whether it’s a wasted vote rather than in case it taints the image of the Academy. Rampling is also battling the fact that 45 Years – a bleak martial drama – has a less Oscars-friendly narrative than the harrowing yet cathartic Room, in which Brie Larson plays a kidnapped single mother. And while Larson has campaigned energetically, Rampling has been largely absent from Hollywood. Some believe that had she done the rounds of post-screening appearances – and even stuck to her guns over the race debate – she might have turned the negative press around and spun the controversy to her advantage. None the less, her other assets may still be sufficient to clinch it. “Historically,” points out Kirkpatrick, “the Academy has loved English actresses”. And for a first-time nominee, Rampling has considerable back catalogue. “She does come with the definite advantage of having been around for so long,” says Feinberg. “People know her and her work. Plus the Oscars are by far the oldest group of voters to weigh in.” But not everyone agrees. Pensioners don’t always embrace other pensioners. Says Thomson: “45 Years is not a story elderly people - like Academy members - care to dwell on.”"
