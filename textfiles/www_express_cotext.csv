2016-02-26,"Getty Downing Street will allegedly create 40 new peers just weeks after the referendum on June 23. Sources close to the Prime Minister claim he will dole them out as rewards to pro-Brussels backers. One speaking to The Times said a pro-Brexit businessman was offered ""anything"" to switch sides. Getty The claim will add to accusations that the Prime Minister is using his office to tilt the referendum in his favour. Eurosceptics said any such scheme would smack of ""corporate elites"" stitching up the vote.

Any move to create more peers will stuff the House of Lords even further. The alleged plan would see the body swell from 816 to 856 members. This week has seen the might of Downing Street fully swing behind the Project Fear campaign to terrify people into staying with Brussels. First the heart of Government used its influence to rally FTSE 100 chief executives to plead for the EU, followed by military chiefs. But the project unravelled when it emerged that scores of mega-employers had rejected Mr Cameron's entreaty to say a Brexit would harm the economy. Early boasts that 80 FTSE 100 bosses would sign up fell far short, leaving him with just 36 major backers. And Downing Street's military advance turned to a rout as well, after generals spoke out about being pressured into signing. D-Day hero Lord Bramall, a former head of the British Army, said the letter was ""not the kind of letter"" he would have written himself. Red-faced spin doctors were forced to apologise to another high-ranking officer, Sir Michael Rose, who was included on the letter but actually backs a Brexit. Ukip MP Douglas Carswell slammed the latest allegations, saying: ""David Cameron should not be handing out peerages to supporters of his in-at-all-costs EU campaign."" A spokesman for the Leave.eu campaign said voters would recoil at the thought of peerages being offered in exchange for political support. He said: ""The British public will be deeply unimpressed by the sight of corporate elites scrambling to shore up the floundering Remain campaign in exchange for fancy titles and red robes.""
