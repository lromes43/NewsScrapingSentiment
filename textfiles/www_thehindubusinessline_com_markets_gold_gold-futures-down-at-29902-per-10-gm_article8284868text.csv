At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month June drifted by Rs 108 or 0.36 per cent to Rs 29,902 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 15 lots. Likewise, the yellow metal for delivery in April declined by Rs 97 or 0.33 per cent to Rs 29,677 per 10 grams in 701 lots. Continued profit-booking by speculators dragged down gold prices at the futures trade, but a firm trend overseas capped the losses, analysts said. Globally, gold climbed 0.6 per cent to $1,240.04 an ounce in Singapore. Published on  February 26, 2016 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
