America is barreling towards authoritarianism at such a breakneck pace that it should alarm every single one of us. But instead of meeting this moment with courage and integrity, the corporate media has utterly capitulated, stuffing money in Trump's pockets, spiking stories that might offend the regime, and firing journalists who refuse to go along and get along. That is not journalism. That’s complicity.  Our model of reader-funded journalism has survived for one reason only: people like you.

Bernie Sanders is not only ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, where the next U.S. presidential primary will take place on February 9, he is also leading her among female voters and proves more electable against Republican rivals, several new surveys show. A tracking poll released Monday by UMass Lowell/7News shows that the senator from Vermont leads Clinton by 16 points among likely Democratic voters, claiming 56 percent support to Clinton's 40 percent support. He would also beat any Republican nominee in a hypothetical face-off by double digits, while Clinton would beat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz by five-point margins and lose to Marco Rubio, the poll found. Monday's poll comes on the heels of a CNN-WMUR survey released Sunday which found Sanders ahead of Clinton among women in New Hampshire by eight percentage points, a huge jump since last week's Iowa caucuses, where Clinton won among female voters by 11 points. Last week, an NBC News/Wall Street/Marist survey showed Sanders leading Clinton among female Democrats in the Granite state, claiming 56 percent support to Clinton's 40 percent. Those results were published just days before feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright scolded young female voters for siding with Sanders, describing their support for the senator as sexist and shallow. Their remarks did little to stem the tide of voters, male and female alike, increasingly turning to Sanders' ""political revolution."" At a rally in Portsmouth on Sunday night, Sanders spoke to another one of his now-signature huge crowds, telling an audience of 1,220 at Great Bay Community College, ""Our most important task is to revitalize American democracy.""
