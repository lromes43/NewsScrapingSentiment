2016-02-26,"For the last two days the Parliament has witnessed intense, but at times acrimonious, debate on the developments at JNU and University of Hyderabad. This has raised a critical question - what is anti-national, and what is not anti-national? This the key issue on which the divide in Indian politics today seems to turn. To be specific, is it anti-national to criticise the hanging of Afzal Guru? Or is that a right that every Indian national should have and be free to exercise? India Today's Karan Thapar put forward these questions to a panel of experts in his show To The Point. The panel included CPI National Secretary and MP D Raja, BJP spokesperson and lawyer Nalin Kohli, well-known Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, APCA Chairman Badshah Sen and highly regarded columnist and commentator Ashok Malik.10 Big Questions

Parties playing politics over nationalism?What is seditious and what is not?Is free speech being systematically stifled?Is the sedtion debate dividing our society?Is it anti-national to express dissent?Can sedition pass for free speech?Who will define nationalism and patriotism?Is dissent muzzled in our country?Is politics behind the escalating JNU war?Should democracy override our patriotism? Badshah Sen, an independent voice in the debate, was asked whether it was anti-national to publicly criticise Supreme Court decision to hang Afzal Guru. ""The Constitution guarantees a certain amount of freedom of speech and expression. There are people who believe that death sentence is wrong and should be removed. On those grounds, to criticise death sentence is perfectly fine. If it goes contrary to what the Supreme Court has said, there can always be a petition filed to the Supreme Court for contempt of court. There's nothing wrong in when people say that the court's decision was a fraud. In five or ten years or in the future, India may abolish death sentence. Then in that case, what these people are saying is correct. Not that Afzal Guru was not guilty. I am not saying that. But did he deserve death sentence is an issue altogether,"" said Sen. ""It is not anti-national to criticise a judgment of the court. It is anti-national, and perhaps illegal, to impute motives to judges if you do not like the verdict,"" said Ashok Malik. ""Chidambaram expressed his doubts on the level of guilt and the quality of evidence against Afzal Guru. He's entitled to that view. But as a minister the government that ended up executing Afzal Guru, did he expressed these doubts in Cabinet meeting? Did he urge the government to seek a review of the judgement by the Supreme Court, if he indeed have doubts?"" added Malik.
