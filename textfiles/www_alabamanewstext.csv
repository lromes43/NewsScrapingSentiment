They’re responsible for managing the National Guard response for disaster in Alabama. The team works under the state’s Emergency Management Agency, dealing with several tasks to execute whenever severe weather strikes. Officials say training is vital when it comes to preparing for severe weather. That’s why the National Guard has several plans in place to deal with a number of scenarios. For Members of the National Guard they say they get more of a sense of pride when they help make a difference at home versus abroad. The National Guard is the only element of the Department of Defense that has both a federal and state mission, providing help from the call of both the Governor of Alabama, and the President of the United States.
