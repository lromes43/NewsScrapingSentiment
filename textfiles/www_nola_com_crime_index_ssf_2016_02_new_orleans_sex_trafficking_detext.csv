2016-02-26,"A federal jury on Thursday (Feb. 25) convicted 25-year-old Timothy Jones of Memphis for holding two teenage girls captive and forcing them to work as prostitutes in Louisiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. Jones, working with unnamed conspirators, held a 17-year-old victim from Baton Rouge and 16-year-old from Memphis - one after the other -- for about two months ending in February 2014, according to a grand jury indictment in July. Authorities arrested Jones at that time at the Residence Inn hotel at 345 St. Joseph Street, where ""Minor Victim 2"" from Memphis was also recovered. Victim 2 told Jones approximately two weeks prior to the arrest that she wanted to go home to Memphis, according to the indictment. ""(Victim 2 told Jones) that she could not handle the pressure, that she did not want Jones to beat her anymore, and that she was 'freezing' and needed medicine for an illness,"" the indictment states. ""Jones responded that he would send her home once she earned enough 'real' money."" Jones kept virtually all of the money that clients paid to the victims, who he supplied with alcohol and drugs, according to the indictment. Jones instructed his victims to steal clients' credit cards, wallets, cash and other valuables. Jones, who also goes by ""King Lucci,"" enforced his will by repeatedly raping and beating his victims, according to the indictment. He also ""beat, punched and choked"" others who worked for him as prostitutes in front of the two victims mentioned in the indictment. Jones advertised his victims' services on escort solicitation websites, and also forced them to recruit clients on Bourbon Street, according to the indictment. The women who worked for Jones performed ""out-call"" services at locations of clients' choosing, as well as ""in-call"" services at hotel rooms in New Orleans that Jones rented. Jones was convicted as charged on eight counts related to sex trafficking and prostitution. He faces a minimum 15-year prison sentence. Sentencing is scheduled before Judge Martin Feldman on June 29.
