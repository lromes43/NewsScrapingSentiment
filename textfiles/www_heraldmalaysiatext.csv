By Mike NelsonThe prisoner's name was Federico, and he was sharing with his visitor the challenge of coping with society's attitudes toward those like him.
""Too little is said about us, and then often in ways so cruel as to wish us wiped out of society entirely,"" Federico said. ""It makes us feel subhuman.""
His visitor nodded, listening intently, as Federico continued: ""We beg you,"" he pleaded, ""to make sure that we are not stripped of our dignity, along with our freedom. So that it is not taken for granted that being secluded means being excluded forever.""
Again his visitor nodded, and then replied, in a pastoral manner befitting a successor of St. Peter.
""It seems important to me,"" said Pope Benedict XVI, ""to encourage everyone to find meaning in your suffering, to aim to help you in the process of rising again. And I will do my part to invite all to think in this just way, not disparagingly but humanely, realizing that anyone can fall, but that God wants everyone to come to him.
""And we must cooperate in the spirit of brotherhood and awareness of our own fragility, so that they can truly rise again and move forward with dignity and always find respect for their dignity, so that it increases. And in this way they can also find joy in life, for life is given to us by the Lord, with his plan.""
This pastoral visit of Pope Benedict -- to the Rebibbia District Prison in Rome on Dec. 18, 2011 -- modeled the corporal work of mercy that all who follow Jesus are called to perform, as Jesus himself suggests to his disciples in Matthew 25:36: ""I was in prison and you visited me.""
Such visits are made by bishops, clergy, religious and laity. Recent popes have done likewise. Pope Francis, within days of his 2013 election, visited a juvenile detention center on Holy Thursday, washing the feet of women and non-Catholics. St. John Paul II visited a prison in 1983 to tell the man who shot him, Mehmet Ali Agca, that he forgave him.
Visiting the imprisoned is perhaps the most challenging among the works of mercy, for it entails dealing with a segment of society many of the rest of us -- as Federico suggested to Pope Benedict -- would just as soon ignore or remember just long enough to criticize or condemn. Some say: ""If they did the crime, let 'em do the time!""
Yet some among us are very clearly called to perform this work, possibly as chaplains or as coordinators of outreach efforts that seek to let these prisoners know that they are cared for, that they have God-given dignity that their criminal actions have not erased, that they have a chance to contribute in a positive way to society.
Some outreach efforts have grown over the years to embrace (and educate) those less inclined to participate in such ministry.
In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the annual ""Get on the Bus"" program, started by nuns in 2000 and now operated by the Center for Restorative Justice Works, has enabled nearly 12,000 children to visit their incarcerated parents on Mother's and/or Father's Day throughout the state. It has since become a statewide ecumenical program.
The effort involves numerous parish and Catholic school volunteers. They assemble care packages that include snacks, art supplies and toys for the children to pass the time as they head out on a long bus ride to see a parent. These volunteers, while not part of the actual prison visits, are faithful to the spirit of Matthew 25:36.
I well recall visiting Los Angeles County Jail years ago with some musician friends. We performed a concert for 200 inmates. Judging by their enthusiastic applause and how one inmate stood up at the end to announce, on behalf of his fellow inmates, how grateful they were for the music and our presence, it had an impact.
My wife, who sang, later said, ""I know some of these men have done terrible things. But I looked at their faces and all I could think was, every one of them is a mother's son.""
Perhaps that is what helps motivate so many detention ministers who regularly visit, comfort and embrace those imprisoned. It matters not what the prisoners' crimes are. It matters only that, for even a few moments of the day, the prisoners are accorded a measure of dignity, humanity and love -- the love of Christ.
That was the message Pope Francis brought last fall to inmates at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia, the first visit ever made by a pope to an American prison.
""This time in your life can only have one purpose: to give you a hand in getting back on the right road, to give you a hand to help you rejoin society,"" the pope told his Sunday morning audience.
""All of us are part of that effort. All of us are invited to encourage, help and enable your rehabilitation.""
