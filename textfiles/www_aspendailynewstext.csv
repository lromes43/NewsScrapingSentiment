2016-02-26," Intimate St. Regis show begins at 8 For the Freddy Jones Band making music has always been a labor of love.  With a new album out last year and a hectic touring schedule, the Chicago-based rock ’n’ roll band has always heeded the siren song of Colorado, returning repeatedly to write yet another chapter in a musical history dating back over 25 years.  The band returns to Aspen tonight for an intimate show at The St. Regis’ Shadow Mountain Lounge at 8. The event is free for standing-room-only guests, and table service is available starting at $300.  Co-founder and lead vocalist Marty Lloyd said Colorado has always been a special place for the band to play, especially in Aspen, which opens its arms wide each time they travel through town.  “I don’t know what it is about Aspen, but it’s always fun and different,” he said Thursday. “We always find ourselves coming back.”  The band’s latest album, “Never Change,” is ironically titled for a band that has seen its lineup evolve greatly over the years. Though all the original members contributed to the new album, Lloyd said that family obligations and time restraints had turned the Freddy Jones Band into more of an annual summertime ritual rather than a full-time endeavor.  “The Freddy Jones Band had really become kind of a weekend warrior, summertime, summer festival kind of band,” he said. “We’d just play a handful of shows, and every other summer we’d come to Colorado, see all of our friends here, and play some shows, but really that was about it. It had really become a glorified, well-paying hobby.  “Not everybody can tour around the country and leave their families and other interests at home, but I’m able to,” Lloyd added with a laugh.  The band now consists of Lloyd, former Gin Blossoms drummer Scott Kusmirek, former Samples bassist Rich Ross, and guitarist Dave Preston, who played with Justin Timberlake. Co-founder and guitarist Wayne Healy is not touring with the band currently, but hopefully “will be joining the band in the very near future as his time permits,” the band’s website says.  With a re-energized line-up, and on the heels of the album’s success, the band is striking out in new directions, including plans to spend a bit more time in Nashville focusing on the music, and especially songwriting.  Prior to making “Never Change,” Lloyd said he got a call from Grammy award-winning producer Justin Niebank, who worked with the band in the 1990s on the acclaimed “North Avenue Wake Up Call” and “Waiting for the Night” albums.  “He called me from LAX the morning after [he won at the Grammys] … and he asks me if we’d be interested in making a record again,” Lloyd said. “It was a labor of love … for him to kind of pull us through the threshold to where he had found himself in his career, and he reached back for us to sort of share his experience, and we’re obviously very grateful. So here we are with the new record and some new musicians around us.”  He added that it took around four years to get the album together, but that the effort was well worth the time. Making the final cut on the album was the “cream of the crop from many batches of songs,” Lloyd said.  He said that Niebank was really pushing him to come up with one final song to end the album off right, and his mother provided the inspiration for the final tune.  “It got to the point where [Niebank] was like, ‘If I had just one more song,’” Lloyd said. “So I was on the phone with my mother shortly after, and she said, ‘Well, then write a song called “One More Song” and be done with it.’ I thank my mom all the time for that idea. It’s one of my favorites on the record. It’s funny how that works.”  Lloyd said that the location in which a band records an album lends a certain flavor to the music, and “Never Change” is no different, taking from the musical vibe of Nashville and Chicago.  He added that while sometimes he misses playing with the original members, “Making new friends is fun, too.”  “We tried to figure out, how can we make it even better?” Lloyd said. “How do we make the live show even better, how can we commute better, how can we be smarter? Really everything.”  The Freddy Jones Band may now be a different animal, but it’s one that is looking forward to returning to a familiar place.  “Here we are coming back to Aspen again, and it’s a home away from home,” Lloyd said. “Always has been. Aspen was really one of the first places that we found as a satellite outside of hometown Chicago. The history goes way back, and the stories are endless.” collin@aspendailynews.com Join our community of readers who value daily beat reporting and in-depth stories alike.
